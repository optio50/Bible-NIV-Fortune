Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and our 
brother Sosthenes,
	--1 Corinthians 1:1
%
To the church of God in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus and called 
to be his holy people, together with all those everywhere who call on the name 
of our Lord Jesus Christ—their Lord and ours:
	--1 Corinthians 1:2
%
Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
	--1 Corinthians 1:3
%
I always thank my God for you because of his grace given you in Christ Jesus.
	--1 Corinthians 1:4
%
For in him you have been enriched in every way—with all kinds of speech and 
with all knowledge—
	--1 Corinthians 1:5
%
God thus confirming our testimony about Christ among you.
	--1 Corinthians 1:6
%
Therefore you do not lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly wait for our Lord 
Jesus Christ to be revealed.
	--1 Corinthians 1:7
%
He will also keep you firm to the end, so that you will be blameless on the day 
of our Lord Jesus Christ.
	--1 Corinthians 1:8
%
God is faithful, who has called you into fellowship with his Son, Jesus Christ 
our Lord.
	--1 Corinthians 1:9
%
I appeal to you, brothers and sisters, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
that all of you agree with one another in what you say and that there be no 
divisions among you, but that you be perfectly united in mind and thought.
	--1 Corinthians 1:10
%
My brothers and sisters, some from Chloe’s household have informed me that 
there are quarrels among you.
	--1 Corinthians 1:11
%
What I mean is this: One of you says, “I follow Paul”; another, “I follow 
Apollos”; another, “I follow Cephas”; still another, “I follow 
Christ.”
	--1 Corinthians 1:12
%
Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Were you baptized in the name of 
Paul?
	--1 Corinthians 1:13
%
I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius,
	--1 Corinthians 1:14
%
so no one can say that you were baptized in my name.
	--1 Corinthians 1:15
%
(Yes, I also baptized the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I don’t 
remember if I baptized anyone else.)
	--1 Corinthians 1:16
%
For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel—not with 
wisdom and eloquence, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.
	--1 Corinthians 1:17
%
For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to 
us who are being saved it is the power of God.
	--1 Corinthians 1:18
%
For it is written: “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise; the intelligence 
of the intelligent I will frustrate.”
	--1 Corinthians 1:19
%
Where is the wise person? Where is the teacher of the law? Where is the 
philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?
	--1 Corinthians 1:20
%
For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, 
God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who 
believe.
	--1 Corinthians 1:21
%
Jews demand signs and Greeks look for wisdom,
	--1 Corinthians 1:22
%
but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to 
Gentiles,
	--1 Corinthians 1:23
%
but to those whom God has called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God 
and the wisdom of God.
	--1 Corinthians 1:24
%
For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God 
is stronger than human strength.
	--1 Corinthians 1:25
%
Brothers and sisters, think of what you were when you were called. Not many of 
you were wise by human standards; not many were influential; not many were of 
noble birth.
	--1 Corinthians 1:26
%
But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the 
weak things of the world to shame the strong.
	--1 Corinthians 1:27
%
God chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things—and the 
things that are not—to nullify the things that are,
	--1 Corinthians 1:28
%
so that no one may boast before him.
	--1 Corinthians 1:29
%
It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom 
from God—that is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption.
	--1 Corinthians 1:30
%
Therefore, as it is written: “Let the one who boasts boast in the Lord.”
	--1 Corinthians 1:31
%
And so it was with me, brothers and sisters. When I came to you, I did not come 
with eloquence or human wisdom as I proclaimed to you the testimony about God.
	--1 Corinthians 2:1
%
For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and him 
crucified.
	--1 Corinthians 2:2
%
I came to you in weakness with great fear and trembling.
	--1 Corinthians 2:3
%
My message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words, but with a 
demonstration of the Spirit’s power,
	--1 Corinthians 2:4
%
so that your faith might not rest on human wisdom, but on God’s power.
	--1 Corinthians 2:5
%
We do, however, speak a message of wisdom among the mature, but not the wisdom 
of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing.
	--1 Corinthians 2:6
%
No, we declare God’s wisdom, a mystery that has been hidden and that God 
destined for our glory before time began.
	--1 Corinthians 2:7
%
None of the rulers of this age understood it, for if they had, they would not 
have crucified the Lord of glory.
	--1 Corinthians 2:8
%
However, as it is written: “What no eye has seen, what no ear has heard, and 
what no human mind has conceived”— the things God has prepared for those 
who love him—
	--1 Corinthians 2:9
%
these are the things God has revealed to us by his Spirit. The Spirit searches 
all things, even the deep things of God.
	--1 Corinthians 2:10
%
For who knows a person’s thoughts except their own spirit within them? In the 
same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.
	--1 Corinthians 2:11
%
What we have received is not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is 
from God, so that we may understand what God has freely given us.
	--1 Corinthians 2:12
%
This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words 
taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual realities with Spirit-taught words.
	--1 Corinthians 2:13
%
The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the 
Spirit of God but considers them foolishness, and cannot understand them 
because they are discerned only through the Spirit.
	--1 Corinthians 2:14
%
The person with the Spirit makes judgments about all things, but such a person 
is not subject to merely human judgments,
	--1 Corinthians 2:15
%
for, “Who has known the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him?” But we 
have the mind of Christ.
	--1 Corinthians 2:16
%
Brothers and sisters, I could not address you as people who live by the Spirit 
but as people who are still worldly—mere infants in Christ.
	--1 Corinthians 3:1
%
I gave you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet ready for it. Indeed, you 
are still not ready.
	--1 Corinthians 3:2
%
You are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and quarreling among you, 
are you not worldly? Are you not acting like mere humans?
	--1 Corinthians 3:3
%
For when one says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,” 
are you not mere human beings?
	--1 Corinthians 3:4
%
What, after all, is Apollos? And what is Paul? Only servants, through whom you 
came to believe—as the Lord has assigned to each his task.
	--1 Corinthians 3:5
%
I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God has been making it grow.
	--1 Corinthians 3:6
%
So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God, 
who makes things grow.
	--1 Corinthians 3:7
%
The one who plants and the one who waters have one purpose, and they will each 
be rewarded according to their own labor.
	--1 Corinthians 3:8
%
For we are co-workers in God’s service; you are God’s field, God’s 
building.
	--1 Corinthians 3:9
%
By the grace God has given me, I laid a foundation as a wise builder, and 
someone else is building on it. But each one should build with care.
	--1 Corinthians 3:10
%
For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is 
Jesus Christ.
	--1 Corinthians 3:11
%
If anyone builds on this foundation using gold, silver, costly stones, wood, 
hay or straw,
	--1 Corinthians 3:12
%
their work will be shown for what it is, because the Day will bring it to 
light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of 
each person’s work.
	--1 Corinthians 3:13
%
If what has been built survives, the builder will receive a reward.
	--1 Corinthians 3:14
%
If it is burned up, the builder will suffer loss but yet will be saved—even 
though only as one escaping through the flames.
	--1 Corinthians 3:15
%
Don’t you know that you yourselves are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit 
dwells in your midst?
	--1 Corinthians 3:16
%
If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy that person; for God’s 
temple is sacred, and you together are that temple.
	--1 Corinthians 3:17
%
Do not deceive yourselves. If any of you think you are wise by the standards of 
this age, you should become “fools” so that you may become wise.
	--1 Corinthians 3:18
%
For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God’s sight. As it is written: 
“He catches the wise in their craftiness”;
	--1 Corinthians 3:19
%
and again, “The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile.”
	--1 Corinthians 3:20
%
So then, no more boasting about human leaders! All things are yours,
	--1 Corinthians 3:21
%
whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present 
or the future—all are yours,
	--1 Corinthians 3:22
%
and you are of Christ, and Christ is of God.
	--1 Corinthians 3:23
%
This, then, is how you ought to regard us: as servants of Christ and as those 
entrusted with the mysteries God has revealed.
	--1 Corinthians 4:1
%
Now it is required that those who have been given a trust must prove faithful.
	--1 Corinthians 4:2
%
I care very little if I am judged by you or by any human court; indeed, I do 
not even judge myself.
	--1 Corinthians 4:3
%
My conscience is clear, but that does not make me innocent. It is the Lord who 
judges me.
	--1 Corinthians 4:4
%
Therefore judge nothing before the appointed time; wait until the Lord comes. 
He will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and will expose the motives 
of the heart. At that time each will receive their praise from God.
	--1 Corinthians 4:5
%
Now, brothers and sisters, I have applied these things to myself and Apollos 
for your benefit, so that you may learn from us the meaning of the saying, 
“Do not go beyond what is written.” Then you will not be puffed up in being 
a follower of one of us over against the other.
	--1 Corinthians 4:6
%
For who makes you different from anyone else? What do you have that you did not 
receive? And if you did receive it, why do you boast as though you did not?
	--1 Corinthians 4:7
%
Already you have all you want! Already you have become rich! You have begun to 
reign—and that without us! How I wish that you really had begun to reign so 
that we also might reign with you!
	--1 Corinthians 4:8
%
For it seems to me that God has put us apostles on display at the end of the 
procession, like those condemned to die in the arena. We have been made a 
spectacle to the whole universe, to angels as well as to human beings.
	--1 Corinthians 4:9
%
We are fools for Christ, but you are so wise in Christ! We are weak, but you 
are strong! You are honored, we are dishonored!
	--1 Corinthians 4:10
%
To this very hour we go hungry and thirsty, we are in rags, we are brutally 
treated, we are homeless.
	--1 Corinthians 4:11
%
We work hard with our own hands. When we are cursed, we bless; when we are 
persecuted, we endure it;
	--1 Corinthians 4:12
%
when we are slandered, we answer kindly. We have become the scum of the earth, 
the garbage of the world—right up to this moment.
	--1 Corinthians 4:13
%
I am writing this not to shame you but to warn you as my dear children.
	--1 Corinthians 4:14
%
Even if you had ten thousand guardians in Christ, you do not have many fathers, 
for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.
	--1 Corinthians 4:15
%
Therefore I urge you to imitate me.
	--1 Corinthians 4:16
%
For this reason I have sent to you Timothy, my son whom I love, who is faithful 
in the Lord. He will remind you of my way of life in Christ Jesus, which agrees 
with what I teach everywhere in every church.
	--1 Corinthians 4:17
%
Some of you have become arrogant, as if I were not coming to you.
	--1 Corinthians 4:18
%
But I will come to you very soon, if the Lord is willing, and then I will find 
out not only how these arrogant people are talking, but what power they have.
	--1 Corinthians 4:19
%
For the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power.
	--1 Corinthians 4:20
%
What do you prefer? Shall I come to you with a rod of discipline, or shall I 
come in love and with a gentle spirit?
	--1 Corinthians 4:21
%
It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a 
kind that even pagans do not tolerate: A man is sleeping with his father’s 
wife.
	--1 Corinthians 5:1
%
And you are proud! Shouldn’t you rather have gone into mourning and have put 
out of your fellowship the man who has been doing this?
	--1 Corinthians 5:2
%
For my part, even though I am not physically present, I am with you in spirit. 
As one who is present with you in this way, I have already passed judgment in 
the name of our Lord Jesus on the one who has been doing this.
	--1 Corinthians 5:3
%
So when you are assembled and I am with you in spirit, and the power of our 
Lord Jesus is present,
	--1 Corinthians 5:4
%
hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his 
spirit may be saved on the day of the Lord.
	--1 Corinthians 5:5
%
Your boasting is not good. Don’t you know that a little yeast leavens the 
whole batch of dough?
	--1 Corinthians 5:6
%
Get rid of the old yeast, so that you may be a new unleavened batch—as you 
really are. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.
	--1 Corinthians 5:7
%
Therefore let us keep the Festival, not with the old bread leavened with malice 
and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
	--1 Corinthians 5:8
%
I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people—
	--1 Corinthians 5:9
%
not at all meaning the people of this world who are immoral, or the greedy and 
swindlers, or idolaters. In that case you would have to leave this world.
	--1 Corinthians 5:10
%
But now I am writing to you that you must not associate with anyone who claims 
to be a brother or sister but is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or 
slanderer, a drunkard or swindler. Do not even eat with such people.
	--1 Corinthians 5:11
%
What business is it of mine to judge those outside the church? Are you not to 
judge those inside?
	--1 Corinthians 5:12
%
God will judge those outside. “Expel the wicked person from among you.”
	--1 Corinthians 5:13
%
If any of you has a dispute with another, do you dare to take it before the 
ungodly for judgment instead of before the Lord’s people?
	--1 Corinthians 6:1
%
Or do you not know that the Lord’s people will judge the world? And if you 
are to judge the world, are you not competent to judge trivial cases?
	--1 Corinthians 6:2
%
Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more the things of this 
life!
	--1 Corinthians 6:3
%
Therefore, if you have disputes about such matters, do you ask for a ruling 
from those whose way of life is scorned in the church?
	--1 Corinthians 6:4
%
I say this to shame you. Is it possible that there is nobody among you wise 
enough to judge a dispute between believers?
	--1 Corinthians 6:5
%
But instead, one brother takes another to court—and this in front of 
unbelievers!
	--1 Corinthians 6:6
%
The very fact that you have lawsuits among you means you have been completely 
defeated already. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be cheated?
	--1 Corinthians 6:7
%
Instead, you yourselves cheat and do wrong, and you do this to your brothers 
and sisters.
	--1 Corinthians 6:8
%
Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not 
be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men 
who have sex with men
	--1 Corinthians 6:9
%
nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will 
inherit the kingdom of God.
	--1 Corinthians 6:10
%
And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, 
you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of 
our God.
	--1 Corinthians 6:11
%
“I have the right to do anything,” you say—but not everything is 
beneficial. “I have the right to do anything”—but I will not be mastered 
by anything.
	--1 Corinthians 6:12
%
You say, “Food for the stomach and the stomach for food, and God will destroy 
them both.” The body, however, is not meant for sexual immorality but for the 
Lord, and the Lord for the body.
	--1 Corinthians 6:13
%
By his power God raised the Lord from the dead, and he will raise us also.
	--1 Corinthians 6:14
%
Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ himself? Shall I then 
take the members of Christ and unite them with a prostitute? Never!
	--1 Corinthians 6:15
%
Do you not know that he who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in 
body? For it is said, “The two will become one flesh.”
	--1 Corinthians 6:16
%
But whoever is united with the Lord is one with him in spirit.
	--1 Corinthians 6:17
%
Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a person commits are outside the 
body, but whoever sins sexually, sins against their own body.
	--1 Corinthians 6:18
%
Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, 
whom you have received from God? You are not your own;
	--1 Corinthians 6:19
%
you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your bodies.
	--1 Corinthians 6:20
%
Now for the matters you wrote about: “It is good for a man not to have sexual 
relations with a woman.”
	--1 Corinthians 7:1
%
But since sexual immorality is occurring, each man should have sexual relations 
with his own wife, and each woman with her own husband.
	--1 Corinthians 7:2
%
The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife 
to her husband.
	--1 Corinthians 7:3
%
The wife does not have authority over her own body but yields it to her 
husband. In the same way, the husband does not have authority over his own body 
but yields it to his wife.
	--1 Corinthians 7:4
%
Do not deprive each other except perhaps by mutual consent and for a time, so 
that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that 
Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.
	--1 Corinthians 7:5
%
I say this as a concession, not as a command.
	--1 Corinthians 7:6
%
I wish that all of you were as I am. But each of you has your own gift from 
God; one has this gift, another has that.
	--1 Corinthians 7:7
%
Now to the unmarried and the widows I say: It is good for them to stay 
unmarried, as I do.
	--1 Corinthians 7:8
%
But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to 
marry than to burn with passion.
	--1 Corinthians 7:9
%
To the married I give this command (not I, but the Lord): A wife must not 
separate from her husband.
	--1 Corinthians 7:10
%
But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her 
husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife.
	--1 Corinthians 7:11
%
To the rest I say this (I, not the Lord): If any brother has a wife who is not 
a believer and she is willing to live with him, he must not divorce her.
	--1 Corinthians 7:12
%
And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to live 
with her, she must not divorce him.
	--1 Corinthians 7:13
%
For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified through his wife, and the 
unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband. Otherwise 
your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy.
	--1 Corinthians 7:14
%
But if the unbeliever leaves, let it be so. The brother or the sister is not 
bound in such circumstances; God has called us to live in peace.
	--1 Corinthians 7:15
%
How do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or, how do you know, 
husband, whether you will save your wife?
	--1 Corinthians 7:16
%
Nevertheless, each person should live as a believer in whatever situation the 
Lord has assigned to them, just as God has called them. This is the rule I lay 
down in all the churches.
	--1 Corinthians 7:17
%
Was a man already circumcised when he was called? He should not become 
uncircumcised. Was a man uncircumcised when he was called? He should not be 
circumcised.
	--1 Corinthians 7:18
%
Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing. Keeping God’s commands 
is what counts.
	--1 Corinthians 7:19
%
Each person should remain in the situation they were in when God called them.
	--1 Corinthians 7:20
%
Were you a slave when you were called? Don’t let it trouble you—although if 
you can gain your freedom, do so.
	--1 Corinthians 7:21
%
For the one who was a slave when called to faith in the Lord is the Lord’s 
freed person; similarly, the one who was free when called is Christ’s slave.
	--1 Corinthians 7:22
%
You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of human beings.
	--1 Corinthians 7:23
%
Brothers and sisters, each person, as responsible to God, should remain in the 
situation they were in when God called them.
	--1 Corinthians 7:24
%
Now about virgins: I have no command from the Lord, but I give a judgment as 
one who by the Lord’s mercy is trustworthy.
	--1 Corinthians 7:25
%
Because of the present crisis, I think that it is good for a man to remain as 
he is.
	--1 Corinthians 7:26
%
Are you pledged to a woman? Do not seek to be released. Are you free from such 
a commitment? Do not look for a wife.
	--1 Corinthians 7:27
%
But if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not 
sinned. But those who marry will face many troubles in this life, and I want to 
spare you this.
	--1 Corinthians 7:28
%
What I mean, brothers and sisters, is that the time is short. From now on those 
who have wives should live as if they do not;
	--1 Corinthians 7:29
%
those who mourn, as if they did not; those who are happy, as if they were not; 
those who buy something, as if it were not theirs to keep;
	--1 Corinthians 7:30
%
those who use the things of the world, as if not engrossed in them. For this 
world in its present form is passing away.
	--1 Corinthians 7:31
%
I would like you to be free from concern. An unmarried man is concerned about 
the Lord’s affairs—how he can please the Lord.
	--1 Corinthians 7:32
%
But a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world—how he can 
please his wife—
	--1 Corinthians 7:33
%
and his interests are divided. An unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about 
the Lord’s affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both body and 
spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world—how 
she can please her husband.
	--1 Corinthians 7:34
%
I am saying this for your own good, not to restrict you, but that you may live 
in a right way in undivided devotion to the Lord.
	--1 Corinthians 7:35
%
If anyone is worried that he might not be acting honorably toward the virgin he 
is engaged to, and if his passions are too strong and he feels he ought to 
marry, he should do as he wants. He is not sinning. They should get married.
	--1 Corinthians 7:36
%
But the man who has settled the matter in his own mind, who is under no 
compulsion but has control over his own will, and who has made up his mind not 
to marry the virgin—this man also does the right thing.
	--1 Corinthians 7:37
%
So then, he who marries the virgin does right, but he who does not marry her 
does better.
	--1 Corinthians 7:38
%
A woman is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, 
she is free to marry anyone she wishes, but he must belong to the Lord.
	--1 Corinthians 7:39
%
In my judgment, she is happier if she stays as she is—and I think that I too 
have the Spirit of God.
	--1 Corinthians 7:40
%
Now about food sacrificed to idols: We know that “We all possess 
knowledge.” But knowledge puffs up while love builds up.
	--1 Corinthians 8:1
%
Those who think they know something do not yet know as they ought to know.
	--1 Corinthians 8:2
%
But whoever loves God is known by God.
	--1 Corinthians 8:3
%
So then, about eating food sacrificed to idols: We know that “An idol is 
nothing at all in the world” and that “There is no God but one.”
	--1 Corinthians 8:4
%
For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as indeed 
there are many “gods” and many “lords”),
	--1 Corinthians 8:5
%
yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things came and for 
whom we live; and there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things 
came and through whom we live.
	--1 Corinthians 8:6
%
But not everyone possesses this knowledge. Some people are still so accustomed 
to idols that when they eat sacrificial food they think of it as having been 
sacrificed to a god, and since their conscience is weak, it is defiled.
	--1 Corinthians 8:7
%
But food does not bring us near to God; we are no worse if we do not eat, and 
no better if we do.
	--1 Corinthians 8:8
%
Be careful, however, that the exercise of your rights does not become a 
stumbling block to the weak.
	--1 Corinthians 8:9
%
For if someone with a weak conscience sees you, with all your knowledge, eating 
in an idol’s temple, won’t that person be emboldened to eat what is 
sacrificed to idols?
	--1 Corinthians 8:10
%
So this weak brother or sister, for whom Christ died, is destroyed by your 
knowledge.
	--1 Corinthians 8:11
%
When you sin against them in this way and wound their weak conscience, you sin 
against Christ.
	--1 Corinthians 8:12
%
Therefore, if what I eat causes my brother or sister to fall into sin, I will 
never eat meat again, so that I will not cause them to fall.
	--1 Corinthians 8:13
%
Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not 
the result of my work in the Lord?
	--1 Corinthians 9:1
%
Even though I may not be an apostle to others, surely I am to you! For you are 
the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.
	--1 Corinthians 9:2
%
This is my defense to those who sit in judgment on me.
	--1 Corinthians 9:3
%
Don’t we have the right to food and drink?
	--1 Corinthians 9:4
%
Don’t we have the right to take a believing wife along with us, as do the 
other apostles and the Lord’s brothers and Cephas?
	--1 Corinthians 9:5
%
Or is it only I and Barnabas who lack the right to not work for a living?
	--1 Corinthians 9:6
%
Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not 
eat its grapes? Who tends a flock and does not drink the milk?
	--1 Corinthians 9:7
%
Do I say this merely on human authority? Doesn’t the Law say the same thing?
	--1 Corinthians 9:8
%
For it is written in the Law of Moses: “Do not muzzle an ox while it is 
treading out the grain.” Is it about oxen that God is concerned?
	--1 Corinthians 9:9
%
Surely he says this for us, doesn’t he? Yes, this was written for us, because 
whoever plows and threshes should be able to do so in the hope of sharing in 
the harvest.
	--1 Corinthians 9:10
%
If we have sown spiritual seed among you, is it too much if we reap a material 
harvest from you?
	--1 Corinthians 9:11
%
If others have this right of support from you, shouldn’t we have it all the 
more? But we did not use this right. On the contrary, we put up with anything 
rather than hinder the gospel of Christ.
	--1 Corinthians 9:12
%
Don’t you know that those who serve in the temple get their food from the 
temple, and that those who serve at the altar share in what is offered on the 
altar?
	--1 Corinthians 9:13
%
In the same way, the Lord has commanded that those who preach the gospel should 
receive their living from the gospel.
	--1 Corinthians 9:14
%
But I have not used any of these rights. And I am not writing this in the hope 
that you will do such things for me, for I would rather die than allow anyone 
to deprive me of this boast.
	--1 Corinthians 9:15
%
For when I preach the gospel, I cannot boast, since I am compelled to preach. 
Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel!
	--1 Corinthians 9:16
%
If I preach voluntarily, I have a reward; if not voluntarily, I am simply 
discharging the trust committed to me.
	--1 Corinthians 9:17
%
What then is my reward? Just this: that in preaching the gospel I may offer it 
free of charge, and so not make full use of my rights as a preacher of the 
gospel.
	--1 Corinthians 9:18
%
Though I am free and belong to no one, I have made myself a slave to everyone, 
to win as many as possible.
	--1 Corinthians 9:19
%
To the Jews I became like a Jew, to win the Jews. To those under the law I 
became like one under the law (though I myself am not under the law), so as to 
win those under the law.
	--1 Corinthians 9:20
%
To those not having the law I became like one not having the law (though I am 
not free from God’s law but am under Christ’s law), so as to win those not 
having the law.
	--1 Corinthians 9:21
%
To the weak I became weak, to win the weak. I have become all things to all 
people so that by all possible means I might save some.
	--1 Corinthians 9:22
%
I do all this for the sake of the gospel, that I may share in its blessings.
	--1 Corinthians 9:23
%
Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one gets the 
prize? Run in such a way as to get the prize.
	--1 Corinthians 9:24
%
Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training. They do it to get 
a crown that will not last, but we do it to get a crown that will last forever.
	--1 Corinthians 9:25
%
Therefore I do not run like someone running aimlessly; I do not fight like a 
boxer beating the air.
	--1 Corinthians 9:26
%
No, I strike a blow to my body and make it my slave so that after I have 
preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified for the prize.
	--1 Corinthians 9:27
%
For I do not want you to be ignorant of the fact, brothers and sisters, that 
our ancestors were all under the cloud and that they all passed through the sea.
	--1 Corinthians 10:1
%
They were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea.
	--1 Corinthians 10:2
%
They all ate the same spiritual food
	--1 Corinthians 10:3
%
and drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank from the spiritual rock that 
accompanied them, and that rock was Christ.
	--1 Corinthians 10:4
%
Nevertheless, God was not pleased with most of them; their bodies were 
scattered in the wilderness.
	--1 Corinthians 10:5
%
Now these things occurred as examples to keep us from setting our hearts on 
evil things as they did.
	--1 Corinthians 10:6
%
Do not be idolaters, as some of them were; as it is written: “The people sat 
down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in revelry.”
	--1 Corinthians 10:7
%
We should not commit sexual immorality, as some of them did—and in one day 
twenty-three thousand of them died.
	--1 Corinthians 10:8
%
We should not test Christ, as some of them did—and were killed by snakes.
	--1 Corinthians 10:9
%
And do not grumble, as some of them did—and were killed by the destroying 
angel.
	--1 Corinthians 10:10
%
These things happened to them as examples and were written down as warnings for 
us, on whom the culmination of the ages has come.
	--1 Corinthians 10:11
%
So, if you think you are standing firm, be careful that you don’t fall!
	--1 Corinthians 10:12
%
No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And God is 
faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you 
are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it.
	--1 Corinthians 10:13
%
Therefore, my dear friends, flee from idolatry.
	--1 Corinthians 10:14
%
I speak to sensible people; judge for yourselves what I say.
	--1 Corinthians 10:15
%
Is not the cup of thanksgiving for which we give thanks a participation in the 
blood of Christ? And is not the bread that we break a participation in the body 
of Christ?
	--1 Corinthians 10:16
%
Because there is one loaf, we, who are many, are one body, for we all share the 
one loaf.
	--1 Corinthians 10:17
%
Consider the people of Israel: Do not those who eat the sacrifices participate 
in the altar?
	--1 Corinthians 10:18
%
Do I mean then that food sacrificed to an idol is anything, or that an idol is 
anything?
	--1 Corinthians 10:19
%
No, but the sacrifices of pagans are offered to demons, not to God, and I do 
not want you to be participants with demons.
	--1 Corinthians 10:20
%
You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons too; you cannot have 
a part in both the Lord’s table and the table of demons.
	--1 Corinthians 10:21
%
Are we trying to arouse the Lord’s jealousy? Are we stronger than he?
	--1 Corinthians 10:22
%
“I have the right to do anything,” you say—but not everything is 
beneficial. “I have the right to do anything”—but not everything is 
constructive.
	--1 Corinthians 10:23
%
No one should seek their own good, but the good of others.
	--1 Corinthians 10:24
%
Eat anything sold in the meat market without raising questions of conscience,
	--1 Corinthians 10:25
%
for, “The earth is the Lord’s, and everything in it.”
	--1 Corinthians 10:26
%
If an unbeliever invites you to a meal and you want to go, eat whatever is put 
before you without raising questions of conscience.
	--1 Corinthians 10:27
%
But if someone says to you, “This has been offered in sacrifice,” then do 
not eat it, both for the sake of the one who told you and for the sake of 
conscience.
	--1 Corinthians 10:28
%
I am referring to the other person’s conscience, not yours. For why is my 
freedom being judged by another’s conscience?
	--1 Corinthians 10:29
%
If I take part in the meal with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of 
something I thank God for?
	--1 Corinthians 10:30
%
So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.
	--1 Corinthians 10:31
%
Do not cause anyone to stumble, whether Jews, Greeks or the church of God—
	--1 Corinthians 10:32
%
even as I try to please everyone in every way. For I am not seeking my own good 
but the good of many, so that they may be saved.
	--1 Corinthians 10:33
%
11 Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ.
	--1 Corinthians 11:1
%
I praise you for remembering me in everything and for holding to the traditions 
just as I passed them on to you.
	--1 Corinthians 11:2
%
But I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of 
the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God.
	--1 Corinthians 11:3
%
Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head.
	--1 Corinthians 11:4
%
But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her 
head—it is the same as having her head shaved.
	--1 Corinthians 11:5
%
For if a woman does not cover her head, she might as well have her hair cut 
off; but if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head 
shaved, then she should cover her head.
	--1 Corinthians 11:6
%
A man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but 
woman is the glory of man.
	--1 Corinthians 11:7
%
For man did not come from woman, but woman from man;
	--1 Corinthians 11:8
%
neither was man created for woman, but woman for man.
	--1 Corinthians 11:9
%
It is for this reason that a woman ought to have authority over her own head, 
because of the angels.
	--1 Corinthians 11:10
%
Nevertheless, in the Lord woman is not independent of man, nor is man 
independent of woman.
	--1 Corinthians 11:11
%
For as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes 
from God.
	--1 Corinthians 11:12
%
Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head 
uncovered?
	--1 Corinthians 11:13
%
Does not the very nature of things teach you that if a man has long hair, it is 
a disgrace to him,
	--1 Corinthians 11:14
%
but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For long hair is given to 
her as a covering.
	--1 Corinthians 11:15
%
If anyone wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice—nor 
do the churches of God.
	--1 Corinthians 11:16
%
In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more 
harm than good.
	--1 Corinthians 11:17
%
In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there are 
divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it.
	--1 Corinthians 11:18
%
No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have 
God’s approval.
	--1 Corinthians 11:19
%
So then, when you come together, it is not the Lord’s Supper you eat,
	--1 Corinthians 11:20
%
for when you are eating, some of you go ahead with your own private suppers. As 
a result, one person remains hungry and another gets drunk.
	--1 Corinthians 11:21
%
Don’t you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God 
by humiliating those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise 
you? Certainly not in this matter!
	--1 Corinthians 11:22
%
For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on 
the night he was betrayed, took bread,
	--1 Corinthians 11:23
%
and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, “This is my body, which 
is for you; do this in remembrance of me.”
	--1 Corinthians 11:24
%
In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, “This cup is the new 
covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.”
	--1 Corinthians 11:25
%
For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s 
death until he comes.
	--1 Corinthians 11:26
%
So then, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy 
manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord.
	--1 Corinthians 11:27
%
Everyone ought to examine themselves before they eat of the bread and drink 
from the cup.
	--1 Corinthians 11:28
%
For those who eat and drink without discerning the body of Christ eat and drink 
judgment on themselves.
	--1 Corinthians 11:29
%
That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen 
asleep.
	--1 Corinthians 11:30
%
But if we were more discerning with regard to ourselves, we would not come 
under such judgment.
	--1 Corinthians 11:31
%
Nevertheless, when we are judged in this way by the Lord, we are being 
disciplined so that we will not be finally condemned with the world.
	--1 Corinthians 11:32
%
So then, my brothers and sisters, when you gather to eat, you should all eat 
together.
	--1 Corinthians 11:33
%
Anyone who is hungry should eat something at home, so that when you meet 
together it may not result in judgment. And when I come I will give further 
directions.
	--1 Corinthians 11:34
%
Now about the gifts of the Spirit, brothers and sisters, I do not want you to 
be uninformed.
	--1 Corinthians 12:1
%
You know that when you were pagans, somehow or other you were influenced and 
led astray to mute idols.
	--1 Corinthians 12:2
%
Therefore I want you to know that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God 
says, “Jesus be cursed,” and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by 
the Holy Spirit.
	--1 Corinthians 12:3
%
There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit distributes them.
	--1 Corinthians 12:4
%
There are different kinds of service, but the same Lord.
	--1 Corinthians 12:5
%
There are different kinds of working, but in all of them and in everyone it is 
the same God at work.
	--1 Corinthians 12:6
%
Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good.
	--1 Corinthians 12:7
%
To one there is given through the Spirit a message of wisdom, to another a 
message of knowledge by means of the same Spirit,
	--1 Corinthians 12:8
%
to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by that one 
Spirit,
	--1 Corinthians 12:9
%
to another miraculous powers, to another prophecy, to another distinguishing 
between spirits, to another speaking in different kinds of tongues, and to 
still another the interpretation of tongues.
	--1 Corinthians 12:10
%
All these are the work of one and the same Spirit, and he distributes them to 
each one, just as he determines.
	--1 Corinthians 12:11
%
Just as a body, though one, has many parts, but all its many parts form one 
body, so it is with Christ.
	--1 Corinthians 12:12
%
For we were all baptized by one Spirit so as to form one body—whether Jews or 
Gentiles, slave or free—and we were all given the one Spirit to drink.
	--1 Corinthians 12:13
%
Even so the body is not made up of one part but of many.
	--1 Corinthians 12:14
%
Now if the foot should say, “Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the 
body,” it would not for that reason stop being part of the body.
	--1 Corinthians 12:15
%
And if the ear should say, “Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the 
body,” it would not for that reason stop being part of the body.
	--1 Corinthians 12:16
%
If the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be? If the 
whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be?
	--1 Corinthians 12:17
%
But in fact God has placed the parts in the body, every one of them, just as he 
wanted them to be.
	--1 Corinthians 12:18
%
If they were all one part, where would the body be?
	--1 Corinthians 12:19
%
As it is, there are many parts, but one body.
	--1 Corinthians 12:20
%
The eye cannot say to the hand, “I don’t need you!” And the head cannot 
say to the feet, “I don’t need you!”
	--1 Corinthians 12:21
%
On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are 
indispensable,
	--1 Corinthians 12:22
%
and the parts that we think are less honorable we treat with special honor. And 
the parts that are unpresentable are treated with special modesty,
	--1 Corinthians 12:23
%
while our presentable parts need no special treatment. But God has put the body 
together, giving greater honor to the parts that lacked it,
	--1 Corinthians 12:24
%
so that there should be no division in the body, but that its parts should have 
equal concern for each other.
	--1 Corinthians 12:25
%
If one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every 
part rejoices with it.
	--1 Corinthians 12:26
%
Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it.
	--1 Corinthians 12:27
%
And God has placed in the church first of all apostles, second prophets, third 
teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healing, of helping, of guidance, and of 
different kinds of tongues.
	--1 Corinthians 12:28
%
Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles?
	--1 Corinthians 12:29
%
Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues? Do all interpret?
	--1 Corinthians 12:30
%
Now eagerly desire the greater gifts. And yet I will show you the most 
excellent way.
	--1 Corinthians 12:31
%
If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only 
a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal.
	--1 Corinthians 13:1
%
If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, 
and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have love, I am 
nothing.
	--1 Corinthians 13:2
%
If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I 
may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing.
	--1 Corinthians 13:3
%
Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not 
proud.
	--1 Corinthians 13:4
%
It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, 
it keeps no record of wrongs.
	--1 Corinthians 13:5
%
Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.
	--1 Corinthians 13:6
%
It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.
	--1 Corinthians 13:7
%
Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there 
are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away.
	--1 Corinthians 13:8
%
For we know in part and we prophesy in part,
	--1 Corinthians 13:9
%
but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears.
	--1 Corinthians 13:10
%
When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned 
like a child. When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me.
	--1 Corinthians 13:11
%
For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to 
face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.
	--1 Corinthians 13:12
%
And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is 
love.
	--1 Corinthians 13:13
%
Follow the way of love and eagerly desire gifts of the Spirit, especially 
prophecy.
	--1 Corinthians 14:1
%
For anyone who speaks in a tongue does not speak to people but to God. Indeed, 
no one understands them; they utter mysteries by the Spirit.
	--1 Corinthians 14:2
%
But the one who prophesies speaks to people for their strengthening, 
encouraging and comfort.
	--1 Corinthians 14:3
%
Anyone who speaks in a tongue edifies themselves, but the one who prophesies 
edifies the church.
	--1 Corinthians 14:4
%
I would like every one of you to speak in tongues, but I would rather have you 
prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues, 
unless someone interprets, so that the church may be edified.
	--1 Corinthians 14:5
%
Now, brothers and sisters, if I come to you and speak in tongues, what good 
will I be to you, unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy 
or word of instruction?
	--1 Corinthians 14:6
%
Even in the case of lifeless things that make sounds, such as the pipe or harp, 
how will anyone know what tune is being played unless there is a distinction in 
the notes?
	--1 Corinthians 14:7
%
Again, if the trumpet does not sound a clear call, who will get ready for 
battle?
	--1 Corinthians 14:8
%
So it is with you. Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue, how 
will anyone know what you are saying? You will just be speaking into the air.
	--1 Corinthians 14:9
%
Undoubtedly there are all sorts of languages in the world, yet none of them is 
without meaning.
	--1 Corinthians 14:10
%
If then I do not grasp the meaning of what someone is saying, I am a foreigner 
to the speaker, and the speaker is a foreigner to me.
	--1 Corinthians 14:11
%
So it is with you. Since you are eager for gifts of the Spirit, try to excel in 
those that build up the church.
	--1 Corinthians 14:12
%
For this reason the one who speaks in a tongue should pray that they may 
interpret what they say.
	--1 Corinthians 14:13
%
For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.
	--1 Corinthians 14:14
%
So what shall I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my 
understanding; I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my 
understanding.
	--1 Corinthians 14:15
%
Otherwise when you are praising God in the Spirit, how can someone else, who is 
now put in the position of an inquirer, say “Amen” to your thanksgiving, 
since they do not know what you are saying?
	--1 Corinthians 14:16
%
You are giving thanks well enough, but no one else is edified.
	--1 Corinthians 14:17
%
I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you.
	--1 Corinthians 14:18
%
But in the church I would rather speak five intelligible words to instruct 
others than ten thousand words in a tongue.
	--1 Corinthians 14:19
%
Brothers and sisters, stop thinking like children. In regard to evil be 
infants, but in your thinking be adults.
	--1 Corinthians 14:20
%
In the Law it is written: “With other tongues and through the lips of 
foreigners I will speak to this people, but even then they will not listen to 
me, says the Lord.”
	--1 Corinthians 14:21
%
Tongues, then, are a sign, not for believers but for unbelievers; prophecy, 
however, is not for unbelievers but for believers.
	--1 Corinthians 14:22
%
So if the whole church comes together and everyone speaks in tongues, and 
inquirers or unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your 
mind?
	--1 Corinthians 14:23
%
But if an unbeliever or an inquirer comes in while everyone is prophesying, 
they are convicted of sin and are brought under judgment by all,
	--1 Corinthians 14:24
%
as the secrets of their hearts are laid bare. So they will fall down and 
worship God, exclaiming, “God is really among you!”
	--1 Corinthians 14:25
%
What then shall we say, brothers and sisters? When you come together, each of 
you has a hymn, or a word of instruction, a revelation, a tongue or an 
interpretation. Everything must be done so that the church may be built up.
	--1 Corinthians 14:26
%
If anyone speaks in a tongue, two—or at the most three—should speak, one at 
a time, and someone must interpret.
	--1 Corinthians 14:27
%
If there is no interpreter, the speaker should keep quiet in the church and 
speak to himself and to God.
	--1 Corinthians 14:28
%
Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what 
is said.
	--1 Corinthians 14:29
%
And if a revelation comes to someone who is sitting down, the first speaker 
should stop.
	--1 Corinthians 14:30
%
For you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and 
encouraged.
	--1 Corinthians 14:31
%
The spirits of prophets are subject to the control of prophets.
	--1 Corinthians 14:32
%
For God is not a God of disorder but of peace—as in all the congregations of 
the Lord’s people.
	--1 Corinthians 14:33
%
Women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but 
must be in submission, as the law says.
	--1 Corinthians 14:34
%
If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at 
home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church.
	--1 Corinthians 14:35
%
Or did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only people it has 
reached?
	--1 Corinthians 14:36
%
If anyone thinks they are a prophet or otherwise gifted by the Spirit, let them 
acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lord’s command.
	--1 Corinthians 14:37
%
But if anyone ignores this, they will themselves be ignored.
	--1 Corinthians 14:38
%
Therefore, my brothers and sisters, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid 
speaking in tongues.
	--1 Corinthians 14:39
%
But everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way.
	--1 Corinthians 14:40
%
Now, brothers and sisters, I want to remind you of the gospel I preached to 
you, which you received and on which you have taken your stand.
	--1 Corinthians 15:1
%
By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. 
Otherwise, you have believed in vain.
	--1 Corinthians 15:2
%
For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died 
for our sins according to the Scriptures,
	--1 Corinthians 15:3
%
that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the 
Scriptures,
	--1 Corinthians 15:4
%
and that he appeared to Cephas, and then to the Twelve.
	--1 Corinthians 15:5
%
After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters 
at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep.
	--1 Corinthians 15:6
%
Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles,
	--1 Corinthians 15:7
%
and last of all he appeared to me also, as to one abnormally born.
	--1 Corinthians 15:8
%
For I am the least of the apostles and do not even deserve to be called an 
apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.
	--1 Corinthians 15:9
%
But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace to me was not without 
effect. No, I worked harder than all of them—yet not I, but the grace of God 
that was with me.
	--1 Corinthians 15:10
%
Whether, then, it is I or they, this is what we preach, and this is what you 
believed.
	--1 Corinthians 15:11
%
But if it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some 
of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?
	--1 Corinthians 15:12
%
If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised.
	--1 Corinthians 15:13
%
And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your 
faith.
	--1 Corinthians 15:14
%
More than that, we are then found to be false witnesses about God, for we have 
testified about God that he raised Christ from the dead. But he did not raise 
him if in fact the dead are not raised.
	--1 Corinthians 15:15
%
For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised either.
	--1 Corinthians 15:16
%
And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your 
sins.
	--1 Corinthians 15:17
%
Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost.
	--1 Corinthians 15:18
%
If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are of all people most to be 
pitied.
	--1 Corinthians 15:19
%
But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who 
have fallen asleep.
	--1 Corinthians 15:20
%
For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also 
through a man.
	--1 Corinthians 15:21
%
For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive.
	--1 Corinthians 15:22
%
But each in turn: Christ, the firstfruits; then, when he comes, those who 
belong to him.
	--1 Corinthians 15:23
%
Then the end will come, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after 
he has destroyed all dominion, authority and power.
	--1 Corinthians 15:24
%
For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.
	--1 Corinthians 15:25
%
The last enemy to be destroyed is death.
	--1 Corinthians 15:26
%
For he “has put everything under his feet.” Now when it says that 
“everything” has been put under him, it is clear that this does not include 
God himself, who put everything under Christ.
	--1 Corinthians 15:27
%
When he has done this, then the Son himself will be made subject to him who put 
everything under him, so that God may be all in all.
	--1 Corinthians 15:28
%
Now if there is no resurrection, what will those do who are baptized for the 
dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized for them?
	--1 Corinthians 15:29
%
And as for us, why do we endanger ourselves every hour?
	--1 Corinthians 15:30
%
I face death every day—yes, just as surely as I boast about you in Christ 
Jesus our Lord.
	--1 Corinthians 15:31
%
If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus with no more than human hopes, what have I 
gained? If the dead are not raised, “Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we 
die.”
	--1 Corinthians 15:32
%
Do not be misled: “Bad company corrupts good character.”
	--1 Corinthians 15:33
%
Come back to your senses as you ought, and stop sinning; for there are some who 
are ignorant of God—I say this to your shame.
	--1 Corinthians 15:34
%
But someone will ask, “How are the dead raised? With what kind of body will 
they come?”
	--1 Corinthians 15:35
%
How foolish! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.
	--1 Corinthians 15:36
%
When you sow, you do not plant the body that will be, but just a seed, perhaps 
of wheat or of something else.
	--1 Corinthians 15:37
%
But God gives it a body as he has determined, and to each kind of seed he gives 
its own body.
	--1 Corinthians 15:38
%
Not all flesh is the same: People have one kind of flesh, animals have another, 
birds another and fish another.
	--1 Corinthians 15:39
%
There are also heavenly bodies and there are earthly bodies; but the splendor 
of the heavenly bodies is one kind, and the splendor of the earthly bodies is 
another.
	--1 Corinthians 15:40
%
The sun has one kind of splendor, the moon another and the stars another; and 
star differs from star in splendor.
	--1 Corinthians 15:41
%
So will it be with the resurrection of the dead. The body that is sown is 
perishable, it is raised imperishable;
	--1 Corinthians 15:42
%
it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is 
raised in power;
	--1 Corinthians 15:43
%
it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural 
body, there is also a spiritual body.
	--1 Corinthians 15:44
%
So it is written: “The first man Adam became a living being”; the last 
Adam, a life-giving spirit.
	--1 Corinthians 15:45
%
The spiritual did not come first, but the natural, and after that the spiritual.
	--1 Corinthians 15:46
%
The first man was of the dust of the earth; the second man is of heaven.
	--1 Corinthians 15:47
%
As was the earthly man, so are those who are of the earth; and as is the 
heavenly man, so also are those who are of heaven.
	--1 Corinthians 15:48
%
And just as we have borne the image of the earthly man, so shall we bear the 
image of the heavenly man.
	--1 Corinthians 15:49
%
I declare to you, brothers and sisters, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the 
kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.
	--1 Corinthians 15:50
%
Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be 
changed—
	--1 Corinthians 15:51
%
in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet 
will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.
	--1 Corinthians 15:52
%
For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal 
with immortality.
	--1 Corinthians 15:53
%
When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable, and the mortal with 
immortality, then the saying that is written will come true: “Death has been 
swallowed up in victory.”
	--1 Corinthians 15:54
%
“Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?”
	--1 Corinthians 15:55
%
The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.
	--1 Corinthians 15:56
%
But thanks be to God! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
	--1 Corinthians 15:57
%
Therefore, my dear brothers and sisters, stand firm. Let nothing move you. 
Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that 
your labor in the Lord is not in vain.
	--1 Corinthians 15:58
%
Now about the collection for the Lord’s people: Do what I told the Galatian 
churches to do.
	--1 Corinthians 16:1
%
On the first day of every week, each one of you should set aside a sum of money 
in keeping with your income, saving it up, so that when I come no collections 
will have to be made.
	--1 Corinthians 16:2
%
Then, when I arrive, I will give letters of introduction to the men you approve 
and send them with your gift to Jerusalem.
	--1 Corinthians 16:3
%
If it seems advisable for me to go also, they will accompany me.
	--1 Corinthians 16:4
%
After I go through Macedonia, I will come to you—for I will be going through 
Macedonia.
	--1 Corinthians 16:5
%
Perhaps I will stay with you for a while, or even spend the winter, so that you 
can help me on my journey, wherever I go.
	--1 Corinthians 16:6
%
For I do not want to see you now and make only a passing visit; I hope to spend 
some time with you, if the Lord permits.
	--1 Corinthians 16:7
%
But I will stay on at Ephesus until Pentecost,
	--1 Corinthians 16:8
%
because a great door for effective work has opened to me, and there are many 
who oppose me.
	--1 Corinthians 16:9
%
When Timothy comes, see to it that he has nothing to fear while he is with you, 
for he is carrying on the work of the Lord, just as I am.
	--1 Corinthians 16:10
%
No one, then, should treat him with contempt. Send him on his way in peace so 
that he may return to me. I am expecting him along with the brothers.
	--1 Corinthians 16:11
%
Now about our brother Apollos: I strongly urged him to go to you with the 
brothers. He was quite unwilling to go now, but he will go when he has the 
opportunity.
	--1 Corinthians 16:12
%
Be on your guard; stand firm in the faith; be courageous; be strong.
	--1 Corinthians 16:13
%
Do everything in love.
	--1 Corinthians 16:14
%
You know that the household of Stephanas were the first converts in Achaia, and 
they have devoted themselves to the service of the Lord’s people. I urge you, 
brothers and sisters,
	--1 Corinthians 16:15
%
to submit to such people and to everyone who joins in the work and labors at it.
	--1 Corinthians 16:16
%
I was glad when Stephanas, Fortunatus and Achaicus arrived, because they have 
supplied what was lacking from you.
	--1 Corinthians 16:17
%
For they refreshed my spirit and yours also. Such men deserve recognition.
	--1 Corinthians 16:18
%
The churches in the province of Asia send you greetings. Aquila and Priscilla 
greet you warmly in the Lord, and so does the church that meets at their house.
	--1 Corinthians 16:19
%
All the brothers and sisters here send you greetings. Greet one another with a 
holy kiss.
	--1 Corinthians 16:20
%
I, Paul, write this greeting in my own hand.
	--1 Corinthians 16:21
%
If anyone does not love the Lord, let that person be cursed! Come, Lord!
	--1 Corinthians 16:22
%
The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you.
	--1 Corinthians 16:23
%
My love to all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen.
	--1 Corinthians 16:24
%
That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with 
our eyes, which we have looked at and our hands have touched—this we proclaim 
concerning the Word of life.
	 --1 John 1:1
%
The life appeared; we have seen it and testify to it, and we proclaim to you 
the eternal life, which was with the Father and has appeared to us.
	 --1 John 1:2
%
We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard, so that you also may have 
fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, 
Jesus Christ.
	 --1 John 1:3
%
We write this to make our joy complete.
	 --1 John 1:4
%
This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you: God is light; in 
him there is no darkness at all.
	 --1 John 1:5
%
If we claim to have fellowship with him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie 
and do not live out the truth.
	 --1 John 1:6
%
But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one 
another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all sin.
	 --1 John 1:7
%
If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.
	 --1 John 1:8
%
If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins 
and purify us from all unrighteousness.
	 --1 John 1:9
%
If we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar and his word is 
not in us.
	 --1 John 1:10
%
My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anybody 
does sin, we have an advocate with the Father—Jesus Christ, the Righteous One.
	 --1 John 2:1
%
He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for 
the sins of the whole world.
	 --1 John 2:2
%
We know that we have come to know him if we keep his commands.
	 --1 John 2:3
%
Whoever says, “I know him,” but does not do what he commands is a liar, and 
the truth is not in that person.
	 --1 John 2:4
%
But if anyone obeys his word, love for God is truly made complete in them. This 
is how we know we are in him:
	 --1 John 2:5
%
Whoever claims to live in him must live as Jesus did.
	 --1 John 2:6
%
Dear friends, I am not writing you a new command but an old one, which you have 
had since the beginning. This old command is the message you have heard.
	 --1 John 2:7
%
Yet I am writing you a new command; its truth is seen in him and in you, 
because the darkness is passing and the true light is already shining.
	 --1 John 2:8
%
Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates a brother or sister is still in 
the darkness.
	 --1 John 2:9
%
Anyone who loves their brother and sister lives in the light, and there is 
nothing in them to make them stumble.
	 --1 John 2:10
%
But anyone who hates a brother or sister is in the darkness and walks around in 
the darkness. They do not know where they are going, because the darkness has 
blinded them.
	 --1 John 2:11
%
I am writing to you, dear children, because your sins have been forgiven on 
account of his name.
	 --1 John 2:12
%
I am writing to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I 
am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one.
	 --1 John 2:13
%
I write to you, dear children, because you know the Father. I write to you, 
fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young 
men, because you are strong, and the word of God lives in you, and you have 
overcome the evil one.
	 --1 John 2:14
%
Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, love 
for the Father is not in them.
	 --1 John 2:15
%
For everything in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and 
the pride of life—comes not from the Father but from the world.
	 --1 John 2:16
%
The world and its desires pass away, but whoever does the will of God lives 
forever.
	 --1 John 2:17
%
Dear children, this is the last hour; and as you have heard that the antichrist 
is coming, even now many antichrists have come. This is how we know it is the 
last hour.
	 --1 John 2:18
%
They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us. For if they had 
belonged to us, they would have remained with us; but their going showed that 
none of them belonged to us.
	 --1 John 2:19
%
But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know the truth.
	 --1 John 2:20
%
I do not write to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do 
know it and because no lie comes from the truth.
	 --1 John 2:21
%
Who is the liar? It is whoever denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a person 
is the antichrist—denying the Father and the Son.
	 --1 John 2:22
%
No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the 
Father also.
	 --1 John 2:23
%
As for you, see that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you. If 
it does, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father.
	 --1 John 2:24
%
And this is what he promised us—eternal life.
	 --1 John 2:25
%
I am writing these things to you about those who are trying to lead you astray.
	 --1 John 2:26
%
As for you, the anointing you received from him remains in you, and you do not 
need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things and 
as that anointing is real, not counterfeit—just as it has taught you, remain 
in him.
	 --1 John 2:27
%
And now, dear children, continue in him, so that when he appears we may be 
confident and unashamed before him at his coming.
	 --1 John 2:28
%
If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who does what is right 
has been born of him.
	 --1 John 2:29
%
See what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called 
children of God! And that is what we are! The reason the world does not know us 
is that it did not know him.
	 --1 John 3:1
%
Dear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet been 
made known. But we know that when Christ appears, we shall be like him, for we 
shall see him as he is.
	 --1 John 3:2
%
All who have this hope in him purify themselves, just as he is pure.
	 --1 John 3:3
%
Everyone who sins breaks the law; in fact, sin is lawlessness.
	 --1 John 3:4
%
But you know that he appeared so that he might take away our sins. And in him 
is no sin.
	 --1 John 3:5
%
No one who lives in him keeps on sinning. No one who continues to sin has 
either seen him or known him.
	 --1 John 3:6
%
Dear children, do not let anyone lead you astray. The one who does what is 
right is righteous, just as he is righteous.
	 --1 John 3:7
%
The one who does what is sinful is of the devil, because the devil has been 
sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy 
the devil’s work.
	 --1 John 3:8
%
No one who is born of God will continue to sin, because God’s seed remains in 
them; they cannot go on sinning, because they have been born of God.
	 --1 John 3:9
%
This is how we know who the children of God are and who the children of the 
devil are: Anyone who does not do what is right is not God’s child, nor is 
anyone who does not love their brother and sister.
	 --1 John 3:10
%
For this is the message you heard from the beginning: We should love one 
another.
	 --1 John 3:11
%
Do not be like Cain, who belonged to the evil one and murdered his brother. And 
why did he murder him? Because his own actions were evil and his brother’s 
were righteous.
	 --1 John 3:12
%
Do not be surprised, my brothers and sisters, if the world hates you.
	 --1 John 3:13
%
We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love each other. 
Anyone who does not love remains in death.
	 --1 John 3:14
%
Anyone who hates a brother or sister is a murderer, and you know that no 
murderer has eternal life residing in him.
	 --1 John 3:15
%
This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And 
we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters.
	 --1 John 3:16
%
If anyone has material possessions and sees a brother or sister in need but has 
no pity on them, how can the love of God be in that person?
	 --1 John 3:17
%
Dear children, let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in 
truth.
	 --1 John 3:18
%
This is how we know that we belong to the truth and how we set our hearts at 
rest in his presence:
	 --1 John 3:19
%
If our hearts condemn us, we know that God is greater than our hearts, and he 
knows everything.
	 --1 John 3:20
%
Dear friends, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God
	 --1 John 3:21
%
and receive from him anything we ask, because we keep his commands and do what 
pleases him.
	 --1 John 3:22
%
And this is his command: to believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and 
to love one another as he commanded us.
	 --1 John 3:23
%
The one who keeps God’s commands lives in him, and he in them. And this is 
how we know that he lives in us: We know it by the Spirit he gave us.
	 --1 John 3:24
%
Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether 
they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.
	 --1 John 4:1
%
This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God: Every spirit that acknowledges 
that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God,
	 --1 John 4:2
%
but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the 
spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is 
already in the world.
	 --1 John 4:3
%
You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them, because the one who is 
in you is greater than the one who is in the world.
	 --1 John 4:4
%
They are from the world and therefore speak from the viewpoint of the world, 
and the world listens to them.
	 --1 John 4:5
%
We are from God, and whoever knows God listens to us; but whoever is not from 
God does not listen to us. This is how we recognize the Spirit of truth and the 
spirit of falsehood.
	 --1 John 4:6
%
Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who 
loves has been born of God and knows God.
	 --1 John 4:7
%
Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.
	 --1 John 4:8
%
This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the 
world that we might live through him.
	 --1 John 4:9
%
This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as 
an atoning sacrifice for our sins.
	 --1 John 4:10
%
Dear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.
	 --1 John 4:11
%
No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives in us and his 
love is made complete in us.
	 --1 John 4:12
%
This is how we know that we live in him and he in us: He has given us of his 
Spirit.
	 --1 John 4:13
%
And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior 
of the world.
	 --1 John 4:14
%
If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they 
in God.
	 --1 John 4:15
%
And so we know and rely on the love God has for us. God is love. Whoever lives 
in love lives in God, and God in them.
	 --1 John 4:16
%
This is how love is made complete among us so that we will have confidence on 
the day of judgment: In this world we are like Jesus.
	 --1 John 4:17
%
There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to 
do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love.
	 --1 John 4:18
%
We love because he first loved us.
	 --1 John 4:19
%
Whoever claims to love God yet hates a brother or sister is a liar. For whoever 
does not love their brother and sister, whom they have seen, cannot love God, 
whom they have not seen.
	 --1 John 4:20
%
And he has given us this command: Anyone who loves God must also love their 
brother and sister.
	 --1 John 4:21
%
Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and everyone who 
loves the father loves his child as well.
	 --1 John 5:1
%
This is how we know that we love the children of God: by loving God and 
carrying out his commands.
	 --1 John 5:2
%
In fact, this is love for God: to keep his commands. And his commands are not 
burdensome,
	 --1 John 5:3
%
for everyone born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has 
overcome the world, even our faith.
	 --1 John 5:4
%
Who is it that overcomes the world? Only the one who believes that Jesus is the 
Son of God.
	 --1 John 5:5
%
This is the one who came by water and blood—Jesus Christ. He did not come by 
water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit who testifies, because 
the Spirit is the truth.
	 --1 John 5:6
%
For there are three that testify:
	 --1 John 5:7
%
the Spirit, the water and the blood; and the three are in agreement.
	 --1 John 5:8
%
We accept human testimony, but God’s testimony is greater because it is the 
testimony of God, which he has given about his Son.
	 --1 John 5:9

Whoever believes in the Son of God accepts this testimony. Whoever does not 
believe God has made him out to be a liar, because they have not believed the 
testimony God has given about his Son.
	 --1 John 5:10
%
And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in 
his Son.
	 --1 John 5:11
%
Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not 
have life.
	 --1 John 5:12
%
I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that 
you may know that you have eternal life.
	 --1 John 5:13
%
This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything 
according to his will, he hears us.
	 --1 John 5:14
%
And if we know that he hears us—whatever we ask—we know that we have what 
we asked of him.

If you see any brother or sister commit a sin that does not lead to death, you 
should pray and God will give them life. I refer to those whose sin does not 
lead to death. There is a sin that leads to death. I am not saying that you 
should pray about that.
	 --1 John 5:16
%
All wrongdoing is sin, and there is sin that does not lead to death.
	 --1 John 5:17

We know that anyone born of God does not continue to sin; the One who was born 
of God keeps them safe, and the evil one cannot harm them.
	 --1 John 5:18
%
We know that we are children of God, and that the whole world is under the 
control of the evil one.
	 --1 John 5:19
%
We know also that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so 
that we may know him who is true. And we are in him who is true by being in his 
Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life.

Dear children, keep yourselves from idols.

%Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, To God’s elect, exiles scattered 
throughout the provinces of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia,
	 --1 Peter 1:1
%
who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through 
the sanctifying work of the Spirit, to be obedient to Jesus Christ and 
sprinkled with his blood: Grace and peace be yours in abundance.
	 --1 Peter 1:2
%
Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! In his great mercy he 
has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus 
Christ from the dead,
	 --1 Peter 1:3
%
and into an inheritance that can never perish, spoil or fade. This inheritance 
is kept in heaven for you,
	 --1 Peter 1:4
%
who through faith are shielded by God’s power until the coming of the 
salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time.
	 --1 Peter 1:5
%
In all this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you may have had 
to suffer grief in all kinds of trials.
	 --1 Peter 1:6
%
These have come so that the proven genuineness of your faith—of greater worth 
than gold, which perishes even though refined by fire—may result in praise, 
glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed.
	 --1 Peter 1:7
%
Though you have not seen him, you love him; and even though you do not see him 
now, you believe in him and are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy,
	 --1 Peter 1:8
%
for you are receiving the end result of your faith, the salvation of your souls.
	 --1 Peter 1:9
%
Concerning this salvation, the prophets, who spoke of the grace that was to 
come to you, searched intently and with the greatest care,
	 --1 Peter 1:10
%
trying to find out the time and circumstances to which the Spirit of Christ in 
them was pointing when he predicted the sufferings of the Messiah and the 
glories that would follow.
	 --1 Peter 1:11
%
It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves but you, when 
they spoke of the things that have now been told you by those who have preached 
the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. Even angels long to look 
into these things.
	 --1 Peter 1:12
%
Therefore, with minds that are alert and fully sober, set your hope on the 
grace to be brought to you when Jesus Christ is revealed at his coming.
	 --1 Peter 1:13
%
As obedient children, do not conform to the evil desires you had when you lived 
in ignorance.
	 --1 Peter 1:14
%
But just as he who called you is holy, so be holy in all you do;
	 --1 Peter 1:15
%
for it is written: “Be holy, because I am holy.”
	 --1 Peter 1:16
%
Since you call on a Father who judges each person’s work impartially, live 
out your time as foreigners here in reverent fear.
	 --1 Peter 1:17
%
For you know that it was not with perishable things such as silver or gold that 
you were redeemed from the empty way of life handed down to you from your 
ancestors,
	 --1 Peter 1:18
%
but with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or defect.
	 --1 Peter 1:19
%
He was chosen before the creation of the world, but was revealed in these last 
times for your sake.
	 --1 Peter 1:20
%
Through him you believe in God, who raised him from the dead and glorified him, 
and so your faith and hope are in God.
	 --1 Peter 1:21
%
Now that you have purified yourselves by obeying the truth so that you have 
sincere love for each other, love one another deeply, from the heart.
	 --1 Peter 1:22
%
For you have been born again, not of perishable seed, but of imperishable, 
through the living and enduring word of God.
	 --1 Peter 1:23
%
For, “All people are like grass, and all their glory is like the flowers of 
the field; the grass withers and the flowers fall,
	 --1 Peter 1:24
%
    but the word of the Lord endures forever.” And this is the word that 
was preached to you.
	 --1 Peter 1:25
%
Therefore, rid yourselves of all malice and all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and 
slander of every kind.
	 --1 Peter 2:1
%
Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up 
in your salvation,

%
As you come to him, the living Stone—rejected by humans but chosen by God and 
precious to him—
	 --1 Peter 2:4
%
you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house to be a 
holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus 
Christ.
	 --1 Peter 2:5
%
For in Scripture it says: “See, I lay a stone in Zion, a chosen and precious 
cornerstone, and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame.”
	 --1 Peter 2:6
%
Now to you who believe, this stone is precious. But to those who do not 
believe, “The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone,”
	 --1 Peter 2:7
%
and, “A stone that causes people to stumble and a rock that makes them 
fall.” They stumble because they disobey the message—which is also what 
they were destined for.
	 --1 Peter 2:8
%
But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s special 
possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of 
darkness into his wonderful light.
	 --1 Peter 2:9
%
Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God; once you had not 
received mercy, but now you have received mercy.
	 --1 Peter 2:10
%
Dear friends, I urge you, as foreigners and exiles, to abstain from sinful 
desires, which wage war against your soul.
	 --1 Peter 2:11
%
Live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing 
wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us.
	 --1 Peter 2:12
%
Submit yourselves for the Lord’s sake to every human authority: whether to 
the emperor, as the supreme authority,
	 --1 Peter 2:13
%
or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to 
commend those who do right.
	 --1 Peter 2:14
%
For it is God’s will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk 
of foolish people.
	 --1 Peter 2:15
%
Live as free people, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil; live 
as God’s slaves.
	 --1 Peter 2:16
%
Show proper respect to everyone, love the family of believers, fear God, honor 
the emperor.
	 --1 Peter 2:17
%
Slaves, in reverent fear of God submit yourselves to your masters, not only to 
those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are harsh.
	 --1 Peter 2:18
%
For it is commendable if someone bears up under the pain of unjust suffering 
because they are conscious of God.
	 --1 Peter 2:19
%
But how is it to your credit if you receive a beating for doing wrong and 
endure it? But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is 
commendable before God.
	 --1 Peter 2:20
%
To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an 
example, that you should follow in his steps.
	 --1 Peter 2:21
%
“He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth.”
	 --1 Peter 2:22
%
When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, 
he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.
	 --1 Peter 2:23
%
“He himself bore our sins” in his body on the cross, so that we might die 
to sins and live for righteousness; “by his wounds you have been healed.”
	 --1 Peter 2:24
%
For “you were like sheep going astray,” but now you have returned to the 
Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.
	 --1 Peter 2:25
%
Wives, in the same way submit yourselves to your own husbands so that, if any 
of them do not believe the word, they may be won over without words by the 
behavior of their wives,
	 --1 Peter 3:1
%
when they see the purity and reverence of your lives.
	 --1 Peter 3:2
%
Your beauty should not come from outward adornment, such as elaborate 
hairstyles and the wearing of gold jewelry or fine clothes.
	 --1 Peter 3:3
%
Rather, it should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle 
and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God’s sight.
	 --1 Peter 3:4
%
For this is the way the holy women of the past who put their hope in God used 
to adorn themselves. They submitted themselves to their own husbands,
	 --1 Peter 3:5
%
like Sarah, who obeyed Abraham and called him her lord. You are her daughters 
if you do what is right and do not give way to fear.
	 --1 Peter 3:6
%
Husbands, in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives, and treat 
them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you of the gracious 
gift of life, so that nothing will hinder your prayers.
	 --1 Peter 3:7
%
Finally, all of you, be like-minded, be sympathetic, love one another, be 
compassionate and humble.
	 --1 Peter 3:8
%
Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult. On the contrary, repay evil 
with blessing, because to this you were called so that you may inherit a 
blessing.
	 --1 Peter 3:9
%
For, “Whoever would love life and see good days must keep their tongue from 
evil and their lips from deceitful speech.
	 --1 Peter 3:10
%
They must turn from evil and do good; they must seek peace and pursue it.
	 --1 Peter 3:11
%
For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous and his ears are attentive to 
their prayer, but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.”
	 --1 Peter 3:12
%
Who is going to harm you if you are eager to do good?
	 --1 Peter 3:13
%
But even if you should suffer for what is right, you are blessed. “Do not 
fear their threats; do not be frightened.”
	 --1 Peter 3:14
%
But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer 
to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do 
this with gentleness and respect,
	 --1 Peter 3:15
%
keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak maliciously against your 
good behavior in Christ may be ashamed of their slander.
	 --1 Peter 3:16
%
For it is better, if it is God’s will, to suffer for doing good than for 
doing evil.
	 --1 Peter 3:17
%
For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, to 
bring you to God. He was put to death in the body but made alive in the Spirit.
	 --1 Peter 3:18
%
After being made alive, he went and made proclamation to the imprisoned 
spirits—
	 --1 Peter 3:19
%
to those who were disobedient long ago when God waited patiently in the days of 
Noah while the ark was being built. In it only a few people, eight in all, were 
saved through water,
	 --1 Peter 3:20
%
and this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also—not the removal of 
dirt from the body but the pledge of a clear conscience toward God. It saves 
you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
	 --1 Peter 3:21
%
who has gone into heaven and is at God’s right hand—with angels, 
authorities and powers in submission to him.
	 --1 Peter 3:22
%
Therefore, since Christ suffered in his body, arm yourselves also with the same 
attitude, because whoever suffers in the body is done with sin.
	 --1 Peter 4:1
%
As a result, they do not live the rest of their earthly lives for evil human 
desires, but rather for the will of God.
	 --1 Peter 4:2
%
For you have spent enough time in the past doing what pagans choose to 
do—living in debauchery, lust, drunkenness, orgies, carousing and detestable 
idolatry.
	 --1 Peter 4:3
%
They are surprised that you do not join them in their reckless, wild living, 
and they heap abuse on you.
	 --1 Peter 4:4
%
But they will have to give account to him who is ready to judge the living and 
the dead.
	 --1 Peter 4:5
%
For this is the reason the gospel was preached even to those who are now dead, 
so that they might be judged according to human standards in regard to the 
body, but live according to God in regard to the spirit.
	 --1 Peter 4:6
%
The end of all things is near. Therefore be alert and of sober mind so that you 
may pray.
	 --1 Peter 4:7
%
Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins.
	 --1 Peter 4:8
%
Offer hospitality to one another without grumbling.
	 --1 Peter 4:9
%
Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as 
faithful stewards of God’s grace in its various forms.
	 --1 Peter 4:10
%
If anyone speaks, they should do so as one who speaks the very words of God. If 
anyone serves, they should do so with the strength God provides, so that in all 
things God may be praised through Jesus Christ. To him be the glory and the 
power for ever and ever. Amen.
	 --1 Peter 4:11
%
Dear friends, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal that has come on you to 
test you, as though something strange were happening to you.
	 --1 Peter 4:12
%
But rejoice inasmuch as you participate in the sufferings of Christ, so that 
you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed.
	 --1 Peter 4:13
%
If you are insulted because of the name of Christ, you are blessed, for the 
Spirit of glory and of God rests on you.
	 --1 Peter 4:14
%
If you suffer, it should not be as a murderer or thief or any other kind of 
criminal, or even as a meddler.
	 --1 Peter 4:15
%
However, if you suffer as a Christian, do not be ashamed, but praise God that 
you bear that name.
	 --1 Peter 4:16
%
For it is time for judgment to begin with God’s household; and if it begins 
with us, what will the outcome be for those who do not obey the gospel of God?
	 --1 Peter 4:17
%
And, “If it is hard for the righteous to be saved, what will become of the 
ungodly and the sinner?”
	 --1 Peter 4:18
%
So then, those who suffer according to God’s will should commit themselves to 
their faithful Creator and continue to do good.
	 --1 Peter 4:19
%
To the elders among you, I appeal as a fellow elder and a witness of Christ’s 
sufferings who also will share in the glory to be revealed:
	 --1 Peter 5:1
%
Be shepherds of God’s flock that is under your care, watching over them—not 
because you must, but because you are willing, as God wants you to be; not 
pursuing dishonest gain, but eager to serve;
	 --1 Peter 5:2
%
not lording it over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock.
	 --1 Peter 5:3
%
And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that 
will never fade away.
	 --1 Peter 5:4
%
In the same way, you who are younger, submit yourselves to your elders. All of 
you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because, “God 
opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble.”
	 --1 Peter 5:5
%
Humble yourselves, therefore, under God’s mighty hand, that he may lift you 
up in due time.
	 --1 Peter 5:6
%
Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you.
	 --1 Peter 5:7
%
Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring 
lion looking for someone to devour.
	 --1 Peter 5:8
%
Resist him, standing firm in the faith, because you know that the family of 
believers throughout the world is undergoing the same kind of sufferings.
	 --1 Peter 5:9
%
And the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after 
you have suffered a little while, will himself restore you and make you strong, 
firm and steadfast.
	 --1 Peter 5:10
%
To him be the power for ever and ever. Amen.
	 --1 Peter 5:11
%
With the help of Silas, whom I regard as a faithful brother, I have written to 
you briefly, encouraging you and testifying that this is the true grace of God. 
Stand fast in it.
	 --1 Peter 5:12
%
She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you her greetings, and 
so does my son Mark.
	 --1 Peter 5:13
%
Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace to all of you who are in Christ.
	 --1 Peter 5:14
%Paul, Silas and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father 
and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace and peace to you.
	 --1 Thessalonians 1:1
%
We always thank God for all of you and continually mention you in our prayers.
	 --1 Thessalonians 1:2
%
We remember before our God and Father your work produced by faith, your labor 
prompted by love, and your endurance inspired by hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.
	 --1 Thessalonians 1:3
%
For we know, brothers and sisters loved by God, that he has chosen you,
	 --1 Thessalonians 1:4
%
because our gospel came to you not simply with words but also with power, with 
the Holy Spirit and deep conviction. You know how we lived among you for your 
sake.
	 --1 Thessalonians 1:5
%
You became imitators of us and of the Lord, for you welcomed the message in the 
midst of severe suffering with the joy given by the Holy Spirit.
	 --1 Thessalonians 1:6
%
And so you became a model to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia.
	 --1 Thessalonians 1:7
%
The Lord’s message rang out from you not only in Macedonia and Achaia—your 
faith in God has become known everywhere. Therefore we do not need to say 
anything about it,
	 --1 Thessalonians 1:8
%
for they themselves report what kind of reception you gave us. They tell how 
you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God,
	 --1 Thessalonians 1:9
%
and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead—Jesus, who 
rescues us from the coming wrath.
	 --1 Thessalonians 1:10
%
You know, brothers and sisters, that our visit to you was not without results.
	 --1 Thessalonians 2:1
%
We had previously suffered and been treated outrageously in Philippi, as you 
know, but with the help of our God we dared to tell you his gospel in the face 
of strong opposition.
	 --1 Thessalonians 2:2
%
For the appeal we make does not spring from error or impure motives, nor are we 
trying to trick you.
	 --1 Thessalonians 2:3
%
On the contrary, we speak as those approved by God to be entrusted with the 
gospel. We are not trying to please people but God, who tests our hearts.
	 --1 Thessalonians 2:4
%
You know we never used flattery, nor did we put on a mask to cover up 
greed—God is our witness.
	 --1 Thessalonians 2:5
%
We were not looking for praise from people, not from you or anyone else, even 
though as apostles of Christ we could have asserted our authority.
	 --1 Thessalonians 2:6
%
Instead, we were like young children among you. Just as a nursing mother cares 
for her children,
	 --1 Thessalonians 2:7
%
so we cared for you. Because we loved you so much, we were delighted to share 
with you not only the gospel of God but our lives as well.
	 --1 Thessalonians 2:8
%
Surely you remember, brothers and sisters, our toil and hardship; we worked 
night and day in order not to be a burden to anyone while we preached the 
gospel of God to you.
	 --1 Thessalonians 2:9
%
You are witnesses, and so is God, of how holy, righteous and blameless we were 
among you who believed.
	 --1 Thessalonians 2:10
%
For you know that we dealt with each of you as a father deals with his own 
children,
	 --1 Thessalonians 2:11
%
encouraging, comforting and urging you to live lives worthy of God, who calls 
you into his kingdom and glory.
	 --1 Thessalonians 2:12
%
And we also thank God continually because, when you received the word of God, 
which you heard from us, you accepted it not as a human word, but as it 
actually is, the word of God, which is indeed at work in you who believe.
	 --1 Thessalonians 2:13
%
For you, brothers and sisters, became imitators of God’s churches in Judea, 
which are in Christ Jesus: You suffered from your own people the same things 
those churches suffered from the Jews
	 --1 Thessalonians 2:14
%
who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets and also drove us out. They 
displease God and are hostile to everyone
	 --1 Thessalonians 2:15
%
in their effort to keep us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be 
saved. In this way they always heap up their sins to the limit. The wrath of 
God has come upon them at last.
	 --1 Thessalonians 2:16
%
But, brothers and sisters, when we were orphaned by being separated from you 
for a short time (in person, not in thought), out of our intense longing we 
made every effort to see you.
	 --1 Thessalonians 2:17
%
For we wanted to come to you—certainly I, Paul, did, again and again—but 
Satan blocked our way.
	 --1 Thessalonians 2:18
%
For what is our hope, our joy, or the crown in which we will glory in the 
presence of our Lord Jesus when he comes? Is it not you?
	 --1 Thessalonians 2:19
%
Indeed, you are our glory and joy.
	 --1 Thessalonians 2:20
%
So when we could stand it no longer, we thought it best to be left by ourselves 
in Athens.
	 --1 Thessalonians 3:1
%
We sent Timothy, who is our brother and co-worker in God’s service in 
spreading the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you in your faith,
	 --1 Thessalonians 3:2
%
so that no one would be unsettled by these trials. For you know quite well that 
we are destined for them.
	 --1 Thessalonians 3:3
%
In fact, when we were with you, we kept telling you that we would be 
persecuted. And it turned out that way, as you well know.
	 --1 Thessalonians 3:4
%
For this reason, when I could stand it no longer, I sent to find out about your 
faith. I was afraid that in some way the tempter had tempted you and that our 
labors might have been in vain.
	 --1 Thessalonians 3:5
%
But Timothy has just now come to us from you and has brought good news about 
your faith and love. He has told us that you always have pleasant memories of 
us and that you long to see us, just as we also long to see you.
	 --1 Thessalonians 3:6
%
Therefore, brothers and sisters, in all our distress and persecution we were 
encouraged about you because of your faith.
	 --1 Thessalonians 3:7
%
For now we really live, since you are standing firm in the Lord.
	 --1 Thessalonians 3:8
%
How can we thank God enough for you in return for all the joy we have in the 
presence of our God because of you?
	 --1 Thessalonians 3:9
%
Night and day we pray most earnestly that we may see you again and supply what 
is lacking in your faith.
	 --1 Thessalonians 3:10
%
Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus clear the way for us to 
come to you.
	 --1 Thessalonians 3:11
%
May the Lord make your love increase and overflow for each other and for 
everyone else, just as ours does for you.
	 --1 Thessalonians 3:12
%
May he strengthen your hearts so that you will be blameless and holy in the 
presence of our God and Father when our Lord Jesus comes with all his holy ones.
	 --1 Thessalonians 3:13
%
As for other matters, brothers and sisters, we instructed you how to live in 
order to please God, as in fact you are living. Now we ask you and urge you in 
the Lord Jesus to do this more and more.
	 --1 Thessalonians 4:1
%
For you know what instructions we gave you by the authority of the Lord Jesus.
	 --1 Thessalonians 4:2
%
It is God’s will that you should be sanctified: that you should avoid sexual 
immorality;
	 --1 Thessalonians 4:3
%
that each of you should learn to control your own body in a way that is holy 
and honorable,
	 --1 Thessalonians 4:4
%
not in passionate lust like the pagans, who do not know God;
	 --1 Thessalonians 4:5
%
and that in this matter no one should wrong or take advantage of a brother or 
sister. The Lord will punish all those who commit such sins, as we told you and 
warned you before.
	 --1 Thessalonians 4:6
%
For God did not call us to be impure, but to live a holy life.
	 --1 Thessalonians 4:7
%
Therefore, anyone who rejects this instruction does not reject a human being 
but God, the very God who gives you his Holy Spirit.
	 --1 Thessalonians 4:8
%
Now about your love for one another we do not need to write to you, for you 
yourselves have been taught by God to love each other.
	 --1 Thessalonians 4:9
%
And in fact, you do love all of God’s family throughout Macedonia. Yet we 
urge you, brothers and sisters, to do so more and more,
	 --1 Thessalonians 4:10
%
and to make it your ambition to lead a quiet life: You should mind your own 
business and work with your hands, just as we told you,
	 --1 Thessalonians 4:11
%
so that your daily life may win the respect of outsiders and so that you will 
not be dependent on anybody.
	 --1 Thessalonians 4:12
%
Brothers and sisters, we do not want you to be uninformed about those who sleep 
in death, so that you do not grieve like the rest of mankind, who have no hope.
	 --1 Thessalonians 4:13
%
For we believe that Jesus died and rose again, and so we believe that God will 
bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in him.
	 --1 Thessalonians 4:14
%
According to the Lord’s word, we tell you that we who are still alive, who 
are left until the coming of the Lord, will certainly not precede those who 
have fallen asleep.
	 --1 Thessalonians 4:15
%
For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the 
voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ 
will rise first.
	 --1 Thessalonians 4:16
%
After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with 
them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord 
forever.
	 --1 Thessalonians 4:17
%
Therefore encourage one another with these words.
	 --1 Thessalonians 4:18
%
Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you,
	 --1 Thessalonians 5:1
%
for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the 
night.
	 --1 Thessalonians 5:2
%
While people are saying, “Peace and safety,” destruction will come on them 
suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.
	 --1 Thessalonians 5:3
%
But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should 
surprise you like a thief.
	 --1 Thessalonians 5:4
%
You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to 
the night or to the darkness.
	 --1 Thessalonians 5:5
%
So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and 
sober.
	 --1 Thessalonians 5:6
%
For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at 
night.
	 --1 Thessalonians 5:7
%
But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a 
breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet.
	 --1 Thessalonians 5:8
%
For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our 
Lord Jesus Christ.
	 --1 Thessalonians 5:9
%
He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together 
with him.
	 --1 Thessalonians 5:10
%
Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you 
are doing.
	 --1 Thessalonians 5:11
%
Now we ask you, brothers and sisters, to acknowledge those who work hard among 
you, who care for you in the Lord and who admonish you.
	 --1 Thessalonians 5:12
%
Hold them in the highest regard in love because of their work. Live in peace 
with each other.
	 --1 Thessalonians 5:13
%
And we urge you, brothers and sisters, warn those who are idle and disruptive, 
encourage the disheartened, help the weak, be patient with everyone.
	 --1 Thessalonians 5:14
%
Make sure that nobody pays back wrong for wrong, but always strive to do what 
is good for each other and for everyone else.
	 --1 Thessalonians 5:15
%
Rejoice always,
	 --1 Thessalonians 5:16
%
pray continually,
	 --1 Thessalonians 5:17
%
give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God’s will for you in Christ 
Jesus.
	 --1 Thessalonians 5:18
%
Do not quench the Spirit.
	 --1 Thessalonians 5:19
%
Do not treat prophecies with contempt
	 --1 Thessalonians 5:20
%
but test them all; hold on to what is good,
	 --1 Thessalonians 5:21
%
reject every kind of evil.
	 --1 Thessalonians 5:22
%
May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through. May your 
whole spirit, soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus 
Christ.
	 --1 Thessalonians 5:23
%
The one who calls you is faithful, and he will do it.
	 --1 Thessalonians 5:24
%
Brothers and sisters, pray for us.
	 --1 Thessalonians 5:25
%
Greet all God’s people with a holy kiss.
	 --1 Thessalonians 5:26
%
I charge you before the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers and 
sisters.
	 --1 Thessalonians 5:27
%
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
	 --1 Thessalonians 5:28
%Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the command of God our Savior and of 
Christ Jesus our hope,
	 --1 Timothy 1:1
%
To Timothy my true son in the faith: Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father 
and Christ Jesus our Lord.
	 --1 Timothy 1:2
%
As I urged you when I went into Macedonia, stay there in Ephesus so that you 
may command certain people not to teach false doctrines any longer
	 --1 Timothy 1:3
%
or to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies. Such things promote 
controversial speculations rather than advancing God’s work—which is by 
faith.
	 --1 Timothy 1:4
%
The goal of this command is love, which comes from a pure heart and a good 
conscience and a sincere faith.
	 --1 Timothy 1:5
%
Some have departed from these and have turned to meaningless talk.
	 --1 Timothy 1:6
%
They want to be teachers of the law, but they do not know what they are talking 
about or what they so confidently affirm.
	 --1 Timothy 1:7
%
We know that the law is good if one uses it properly.
	 --1 Timothy 1:8
%
We also know that the law is made not for the righteous but for lawbreakers and 
rebels, the ungodly and sinful, the unholy and irreligious, for those who kill 
their fathers or mothers, for murderers,
	 --1 Timothy 1:9
%
for the sexually immoral, for those practicing homosexuality, for slave traders 
and liars and perjurers—and for whatever else is contrary to the sound 
doctrine
	 --1 Timothy 1:10
%
that conforms to the gospel concerning the glory of the blessed God, which he 
entrusted to me.
	 --1 Timothy 1:11
%
I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has given me strength, that he considered me 
trustworthy, appointing me to his service.
	 --1 Timothy 1:12
%
Even though I was once a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man, I was 
shown mercy because I acted in ignorance and unbelief.
	 --1 Timothy 1:13
%
The grace of our Lord was poured out on me abundantly, along with the faith and 
love that are in Christ Jesus.
	 --1 Timothy 1:14
%
Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came 
into the world to save sinners—of whom I am the worst.
	 --1 Timothy 1:15
%
But for that very reason I was shown mercy so that in me, the worst of sinners, 
Christ Jesus might display his immense patience as an example for those who 
would believe in him and receive eternal life.
	 --1 Timothy 1:16
%
Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory 
for ever and ever. Amen.
	 --1 Timothy 1:17
%
Timothy, my son, I am giving you this command in keeping with the prophecies 
once made about you, so that by recalling them you may fight the battle well,
	 --1 Timothy 1:18
%
holding on to faith and a good conscience, which some have rejected and so have 
suffered shipwreck with regard to the faith.
	 --1 Timothy 1:19
%
Among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan to be 
taught not to blaspheme.
	 --1 Timothy 1:20
%
I urge, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercession and 
thanksgiving be made for all people—
	 --1 Timothy 2:1
%
for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives 
in all godliness and holiness.
	 --1 Timothy 2:2
%
This is good, and pleases God our Savior,
	 --1 Timothy 2:3
%
who wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.
	 --1 Timothy 2:4
%
For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ 
Jesus,
	 --1 Timothy 2:5
%
who gave himself as a ransom for all people. This has now been witnessed to at 
the proper time.
	 --1 Timothy 2:6
%
And for this purpose I was appointed a herald and an apostle—I am telling the 
truth, I am not lying—and a true and faithful teacher of the Gentiles.
	 --1 Timothy 2:7
%
Therefore I want the men everywhere to pray, lifting up holy hands without 
anger or disputing.
	 --1 Timothy 2:8
%
I also want the women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, adorning 
themselves, not with elaborate hairstyles or gold or pearls or expensive 
clothes,
	 --1 Timothy 2:9
%
but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to worship God.
	 --1 Timothy 2:10
%
A woman should learn in quietness and full submission.
	 --1 Timothy 2:11
%
I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be 
quiet.
	 --1 Timothy 2:12
%
For Adam was formed first, then Eve.
	 --1 Timothy 2:13
%
And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became 
a sinner.
	 --1 Timothy 2:14
%
But women will be saved through childbearing—if they continue in faith, love 
and holiness with propriety.
	 --1 Timothy 2:15
%
Here is a trustworthy saying: Whoever aspires to be an overseer desires a noble 
task.
	 --1 Timothy 3:1
%
Now the overseer is to be above reproach, faithful to his wife, temperate, 
self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach,
	 --1 Timothy 3:2
%
not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover 
of money.
	 --1 Timothy 3:3
%
He must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him, and he 
must do so in a manner worthy of full respect.
	 --1 Timothy 3:4
%
(If anyone does not know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of 
God’s church?)
	 --1 Timothy 3:5
%
He must not be a recent convert, or he may become conceited and fall under the 
same judgment as the devil.
	 --1 Timothy 3:6
%
He must also have a good reputation with outsiders, so that he will not fall 
into disgrace and into the devil’s trap.
	 --1 Timothy 3:7
%
In the same way, deacons are to be worthy of respect, sincere, not indulging in 
much wine, and not pursuing dishonest gain.
	 --1 Timothy 3:8
%
They must keep hold of the deep truths of the faith with a clear conscience.
	 --1 Timothy 3:9
%
They must first be tested; and then if there is nothing against them, let them 
serve as deacons.
	 --1 Timothy 3:10
%
In the same way, the women are to be worthy of respect, not malicious talkers 
but temperate and trustworthy in everything.
	 --1 Timothy 3:11
%
A deacon must be faithful to his wife and must manage his children and his 
household well.
	 --1 Timothy 3:12
%
Those who have served well gain an excellent standing and great assurance in 
their faith in Christ Jesus.
	 --1 Timothy 3:13
%
Although I hope to come to you soon, I am writing you these instructions so 
that,
	 --1 Timothy 3:14
%
if I am delayed, you will know how people ought to conduct themselves in 
God’s household, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and 
foundation of the truth.
	 --1 Timothy 3:15
%
Beyond all question, the mystery from which true godliness springs is great: He 
appeared in the flesh, was vindicated by the Spirit, was seen by angels, was 
preached among the nations, was believed on in the world, was taken up in glory.
	 --1 Timothy 3:16
%
The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and 
follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons.
	 --1 Timothy 4:1
%
Such teachings come through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been 
seared as with a hot iron.
	 --1 Timothy 4:2
%
They forbid people to marry and order them to abstain from certain foods, which 
God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and who know 
the truth.
	 --1 Timothy 4:3
%
For everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is 
received with thanksgiving,
	 --1 Timothy 4:4
%
because it is consecrated by the word of God and prayer.
	 --1 Timothy 4:5
%
If you point these things out to the brothers and sisters, you will be a good 
minister of Christ Jesus, nourished on the truths of the faith and of the good 
teaching that you have followed.
	 --1 Timothy 4:6
%
Have nothing to do with godless myths and old wives’ tales; rather, train 
yourself to be godly.
	 --1 Timothy 4:7
%
For physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things, 
holding promise for both the present life and the life to come.
	 --1 Timothy 4:8
%
This is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance.
	 --1 Timothy 4:9
%
That is why we labor and strive, because we have put our hope in the living 
God, who is the Savior of all people, and especially of those who believe.
	 --1 Timothy 4:10
%
Command and teach these things.
	 --1 Timothy 4:11
%
Don’t let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example 
for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith and in purity.
	 --1 Timothy 4:12
%
Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to preaching 
and to teaching.
	 --1 Timothy 4:13
%
Do not neglect your gift, which was given you through prophecy when the body of 
elders laid their hands on you.
	 --1 Timothy 4:14
%
Be diligent in these matters; give yourself wholly to them, so that everyone 
may see your progress.
	 --1 Timothy 4:15
%
Watch your life and doctrine closely. Persevere in them, because if you do, you 
will save both yourself and your hearers.
	 --1 Timothy 4:16
%
Do not rebuke an older man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. 
Treat younger men as brothers,
	 --1 Timothy 5:1
%
older women as mothers, and younger women as sisters, with absolute purity.
	 --1 Timothy 5:2
%
Give proper recognition to those widows who are really in need.
	 --1 Timothy 5:3
%
But if a widow has children or grandchildren, these should learn first of all 
to put their religion into practice by caring for their own family and so 
repaying their parents and grandparents, for this is pleasing to God.
	 --1 Timothy 5:4
%
The widow who is really in need and left all alone puts her hope in God and 
continues night and day to pray and to ask God for help.
	 --1 Timothy 5:5
%
But the widow who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives.
	 --1 Timothy 5:6
%
Give the people these instructions, so that no one may be open to blame.
	 --1 Timothy 5:7
%
Anyone who does not provide for their relatives, and especially for their own 
household, has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.
	 --1 Timothy 5:8
%
No widow may be put on the list of widows unless she is over sixty, has been 
faithful to her husband,
	 --1 Timothy 5:9
%
and is well known for her good deeds, such as bringing up children, showing 
hospitality, washing the feet of the Lord’s people, helping those in trouble 
and devoting herself to all kinds of good deeds.
	 --1 Timothy 5:10
%
As for younger widows, do not put them on such a list. For when their sensual 
desires overcome their dedication to Christ, they want to marry.
	 --1 Timothy 5:11
%
Thus they bring judgment on themselves, because they have broken their first 
pledge.
	 --1 Timothy 5:12
%
Besides, they get into the habit of being idle and going about from house to 
house. And not only do they become idlers, but also busybodies who talk 
nonsense, saying things they ought not to.
	 --1 Timothy 5:13
%
So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have children, to manage their homes 
and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander.
	 --1 Timothy 5:14
%
Some have in fact already turned away to follow Satan.
	 --1 Timothy 5:15
%
If any woman who is a believer has widows in her care, she should continue to 
help them and not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can 
help those widows who are really in need.
	 --1 Timothy 5:16
%
The elders who direct the affairs of the church well are worthy of double 
honor, especially those whose work is preaching and teaching.
	 --1 Timothy 5:17
%
For Scripture says, “Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the 
grain,” and “The worker deserves his wages.”
	 --1 Timothy 5:18
%
Do not entertain an accusation against an elder unless it is brought by two or 
three witnesses.
	 --1 Timothy 5:19
%
But those elders who are sinning you are to reprove before everyone, so that 
the others may take warning.
	 --1 Timothy 5:20
%
I charge you, in the sight of God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels, to 
keep these instructions without partiality, and to do nothing out of favoritism.
	 --1 Timothy 5:21
%
Do not be hasty in the laying on of hands, and do not share in the sins of 
others. Keep yourself pure.
	 --1 Timothy 5:22
%
Stop drinking only water, and use a little wine because of your stomach and 
your frequent illnesses.
	 --1 Timothy 5:23
%
The sins of some are obvious, reaching the place of judgment ahead of them; the 
sins of others trail behind them.
	 --1 Timothy 5:24
%
In the same way, good deeds are obvious, and even those that are not obvious 
cannot remain hidden forever.
	 --1 Timothy 5:25
%
All who are under the yoke of slavery should consider their masters worthy of 
full respect, so that God’s name and our teaching may not be slandered.
	 --1 Timothy 6:1
%
Those who have believing masters should not show them disrespect just because 
they are fellow believers. Instead, they should serve them even better because 
their masters are dear to them as fellow believers and are devoted to the 
welfare of their slaves. These are the things you are to teach and insist on.
	 --1 Timothy 6:2
%
If anyone teaches otherwise and does not agree to the sound instruction of our 
Lord Jesus Christ and to godly teaching,
	 --1 Timothy 6:3
%
they are conceited and understand nothing. They have an unhealthy interest in 
controversies and quarrels about words that result in envy, strife, malicious 
talk, evil suspicions
	 --1 Timothy 6:4
%
and constant friction between people of corrupt mind, who have been robbed of 
the truth and who think that godliness is a means to financial gain.
	 --1 Timothy 6:5
%
But godliness with contentment is great gain.
	 --1 Timothy 6:6
%
For we brought nothing into the world, and we can take nothing out of it.
	 --1 Timothy 6:7
%
But if we have food and clothing, we will be content with that.
	 --1 Timothy 6:8
%
Those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many 
foolish and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction.
	 --1 Timothy 6:9
%
For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for 
money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.
	 --1 Timothy 6:10
%
But you, man of God, flee from all this, and pursue righteousness, godliness, 
faith, love, endurance and gentleness.
	 --1 Timothy 6:11
%
Fight the good fight of the faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which you 
were called when you made your good confession in the presence of many 
witnesses.
	 --1 Timothy 6:12
%
In the sight of God, who gives life to everything, and of Christ Jesus, who 
while testifying before Pontius Pilate made the good confession, I charge you
	 --1 Timothy 6:13
%
to keep this command without spot or blame until the appearing of our Lord 
Jesus Christ,
	 --1 Timothy 6:14
%
which God will bring about in his own time—God, the blessed and only Ruler, 
the King of kings and Lord of lords,
	 --1 Timothy 6:15
%
who alone is immortal and who lives in unapproachable light, whom no one has 
seen or can see. To him be honor and might forever. Amen.
	 --1 Timothy 6:16
%
Command those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant nor to put 
their hope in wealth, which is so uncertain, but to put their hope in God, who 
richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment.
	 --1 Timothy 6:17
%
Command them to do good, to be rich in good deeds, and to be generous and 
willing to share.
	 --1 Timothy 6:18
%
In this way they will lay up treasure for themselves as a firm foundation for 
the coming age, so that they may take hold of the life that is truly life.
	 --1 Timothy 6:19
%
Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to your care. Turn away from godless 
chatter and the opposing ideas of what is falsely called knowledge,
	 --1 Timothy 6:20
%
which some have professed and in so doing have departed from the faith. Grace 
be with you all.
	 --1 Timothy 6:21
%Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, 
To the church of God in Corinth, together with all his holy people throughout 
Achaia:
	--2 Corinthians 1:1
%
Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
	--2 Corinthians 1:2
%
Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of 
compassion and the God of all comfort,
	--2 Corinthians 1:3
%
who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any 
trouble with the comfort we ourselves receive from God.
	--2 Corinthians 1:4
%
For just as we share abundantly in the sufferings of Christ, so also our 
comfort abounds through Christ.
	--2 Corinthians 1:5
%
If we are distressed, it is for your comfort and salvation; if we are 
comforted, it is for your comfort, which produces in you patient endurance of 
the same sufferings we suffer.
	--2 Corinthians 1:6
%
And our hope for you is firm, because we know that just as you share in our 
sufferings, so also you share in our comfort.
	--2 Corinthians 1:7
%
We do not want you to be uninformed, brothers and sisters, about the troubles 
we experienced in the province of Asia. We were under great pressure, far 
beyond our ability to endure, so that we despaired of life itself.
	--2 Corinthians 1:8
%
Indeed, we felt we had received the sentence of death. But this happened that 
we might not rely on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead.
	--2 Corinthians 1:9
%
He has delivered us from such a deadly peril, and he will deliver us again. On 
him we have set our hope that he will continue to deliver us,
	--2 Corinthians 1:10
%
as you help us by your prayers. Then many will give thanks on our behalf for 
the gracious favor granted us in answer to the prayers of many.
	--2 Corinthians 1:11
%
Now this is our boast: Our conscience testifies that we have conducted 
ourselves in the world, and especially in our relations with you, with 
integrity and godly sincerity. We have done so, relying not on worldly wisdom 
but on God’s grace.
	--2 Corinthians 1:12
%
For we do not write you anything you cannot read or understand. And I hope that,
	--2 Corinthians 1:13
%
as you have understood us in part, you will come to understand fully that you 
can boast of us just as we will boast of you in the day of the Lord Jesus.
	--2 Corinthians 1:14
%
Because I was confident of this, I wanted to visit you first so that you might 
benefit twice.
	--2 Corinthians 1:15
%
I wanted to visit you on my way to Macedonia and to come back to you from 
Macedonia, and then to have you send me on my way to Judea.
	--2 Corinthians 1:16
%
Was I fickle when I intended to do this? Or do I make my plans in a worldly 
manner so that in the same breath I say both “Yes, yes” and “No, no”?
	--2 Corinthians 1:17
%
But as surely as God is faithful, our message to you is not “Yes” and 
“No.”
	--2 Corinthians 1:18
%
For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us—by me and 
Silas and Timothy—was not “Yes” and “No,” but in him it has always 
been “Yes.”
	--2 Corinthians 1:19
%
For no matter how many promises God has made, they are “Yes” in Christ. And 
so through him the “Amen” is spoken by us to the glory of God.
	--2 Corinthians 1:20
%
Now it is God who makes both us and you stand firm in Christ. He anointed us,
	--2 Corinthians 1:21
%
set his seal of ownership on us, and put his Spirit in our hearts as a deposit, 
guaranteeing what is to come.
	--2 Corinthians 1:22
%
I call God as my witness—and I stake my life on it—that it was in order to 
spare you that I did not return to Corinth.
	--2 Corinthians 1:23
%
Not that we lord it over your faith, but we work with you for your joy, because 
it is by faith you stand firm.
	--2 Corinthians 1:24
%
2 So I made up my mind that I would not make another painful visit to you.
	--2 Corinthians 2:1
%
For if I grieve you, who is left to make me glad but you whom I have grieved?
	--2 Corinthians 2:2
%
I wrote as I did, so that when I came I would not be distressed by those who 
should have made me rejoice. I had confidence in all of you, that you would all 
share my joy.
	--2 Corinthians 2:3
%
For I wrote you out of great distress and anguish of heart and with many tears, 
not to grieve you but to let you know the depth of my love for you.
	--2 Corinthians 2:4
%
If anyone has caused grief, he has not so much grieved me as he has grieved all 
of you to some extent—not to put it too severely.
	--2 Corinthians 2:5
%
The punishment inflicted on him by the majority is sufficient.
	--2 Corinthians 2:6
%
Now instead, you ought to forgive and comfort him, so that he will not be 
overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.
	--2 Corinthians 2:7
%
I urge you, therefore, to reaffirm your love for him.
	--2 Corinthians 2:8
%
Another reason I wrote you was to see if you would stand the test and be 
obedient in everything.
	--2 Corinthians 2:9
%
Anyone you forgive, I also forgive. And what I have forgiven—if there was 
anything to forgive—I have forgiven in the sight of Christ for your sake,
	--2 Corinthians 2:10
%
in order that Satan might not outwit us. For we are not unaware of his schemes.
	--2 Corinthians 2:11
%
Now when I went to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ and found that the Lord 
had opened a door for me,

I still had no peace of mind, because I did not find my brother Titus there. So 
I said goodbye to them and went on to Macedonia.
	--2 Corinthians 2:13
%
But thanks be to God, who always leads us as captives in Christ’s triumphal 
procession and uses us to spread the aroma of the knowledge of him everywhere.
	--2 Corinthians 2:14
%
For we are to God the pleasing aroma of Christ among those who are being saved 
and those who are perishing.
	--2 Corinthians 2:15
%
To the one we are an aroma that brings death; to the other, an aroma that 
brings life. And who is equal to such a task?
	--2 Corinthians 2:16
%
Unlike so many, we do not peddle the word of God for profit. On the contrary, 
in Christ we speak before God with sincerity, as those sent from God.
	--2 Corinthians 2:17
%
Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, like some people, 
letters of recommendation to you or from you?
	--2 Corinthians 3:1
%
You yourselves are our letter, written on our hearts, known and read by 
everyone.
	--2 Corinthians 3:2
%
You show that you are a letter from Christ, the result of our ministry, written 
not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but 
on tablets of human hearts.
	--2 Corinthians 3:3
%
Such confidence we have through Christ before God.
	--2 Corinthians 3:4
%
Not that we are competent in ourselves to claim anything for ourselves, but our 
competence comes from God.
	--2 Corinthians 3:5
%
He has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant—not of the letter but 
of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.
	--2 Corinthians 3:6
%
Now if the ministry that brought death, which was engraved in letters on stone, 
came with glory, so that the Israelites could not look steadily at the face of 
Moses because of its glory, transitory though it was,
	--2 Corinthians 3:7
%
will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious?
	--2 Corinthians 3:8
%
If the ministry that brought condemnation was glorious, how much more glorious 
is the ministry that brings righteousness!
	--2 Corinthians 3:9
%
For what was glorious has no glory now in comparison with the surpassing glory.
	--2 Corinthians 3:10
%
And if what was transitory came with glory, how much greater is the glory of 
that which lasts!
	--2 Corinthians 3:11
%
Therefore, since we have such a hope, we are very bold.
	--2 Corinthians 3:12
%
We are not like Moses, who would put a veil over his face to prevent the 
Israelites from seeing the end of what was passing away.
	--2 Corinthians 3:13
%
But their minds were made dull, for to this day the same veil remains when the 
old covenant is read. It has not been removed, because only in Christ is it 
taken away.
	--2 Corinthians 3:14
%
Even to this day when Moses is read, a veil covers their hearts.
	--2 Corinthians 3:15
%
But whenever anyone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.
	--2 Corinthians 3:16
%
Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is 
freedom.
	--2 Corinthians 3:17
%
And we all, who with unveiled faces contemplate the Lord’s glory, are being 
transformed into his image with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the 
Lord, who is the Spirit.
	--2 Corinthians 3:18
%
Therefore, since through God’s mercy we have this ministry, we do not lose 
heart.
	--2 Corinthians 4:1
%
Rather, we have renounced secret and shameful ways; we do not use deception, 
nor do we distort the word of God. On the contrary, by setting forth the truth 
plainly we commend ourselves to everyone’s conscience in the sight of God.
	--2 Corinthians 4:2
%
And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing.
	--2 Corinthians 4:3
%
The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot 
see the light of the gospel that displays the glory of Christ, who is the image 
of God.
	--2 Corinthians 4:4
%
For what we preach is not ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as 
your servants for Jesus’ sake.
	--2 Corinthians 4:5
%
For God, who said, “Let light shine out of darkness,” made his light shine 
in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of God’s glory displayed 
in the face of Christ.
	--2 Corinthians 4:6
%
But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing 
power is from God and not from us.
	--2 Corinthians 4:7
%
We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in 
despair;
	--2 Corinthians 4:8
%
persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed.
	--2 Corinthians 4:9
%
We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of 
Jesus may also be revealed in our body.
	--2 Corinthians 4:10
%
For we who are alive are always being given over to death for Jesus’ sake, so 
that his life may also be revealed in our mortal body.
	--2 Corinthians 4:11
%
So then, death is at work in us, but life is at work in you.
	--2 Corinthians 4:12
%
It is written: “I believed; therefore I have spoken.” Since we have that 
same spirit of faith, we also believe and therefore speak,
	--2 Corinthians 4:13
%
because we know that the one who raised the Lord Jesus from the dead will also 
raise us with Jesus and present us with you to himself.
	--2 Corinthians 4:14
%
All this is for your benefit, so that the grace that is reaching more and more 
people may cause thanksgiving to overflow to the glory of God.
	--2 Corinthians 4:15
%
Therefore we do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, yet 
inwardly we are being renewed day by day.
	--2 Corinthians 4:16
%
For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that 
far outweighs them all.
	--2 Corinthians 4:17
%
So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is 
seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.
	--2 Corinthians 4:18
%
For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a 
building from God, an eternal house in heaven, not built by human hands.
	--2 Corinthians 5:1
%
Meanwhile we groan, longing to be clothed instead with our heavenly dwelling,
	--2 Corinthians 5:2
%
because when we are clothed, we will not be found naked.
	--2 Corinthians 5:3
%
For while we are in this tent, we groan and are burdened, because we do not 
wish to be unclothed but to be clothed instead with our heavenly dwelling, so 
that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.
	--2 Corinthians 5:4
%
Now the one who has fashioned us for this very purpose is God, who has given us 
the Spirit as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come.
	--2 Corinthians 5:5
%
Therefore we are always confident and know that as long as we are at home in 
the body we are away from the Lord.
	--2 Corinthians 5:6
%
For we live by faith, not by sight.
	--2 Corinthians 5:7
%
We are confident, I say, and would prefer to be away from the body and at home 
with the Lord.
	--2 Corinthians 5:8
%
So we make it our goal to please him, whether we are at home in the body or 
away from it.
	--2 Corinthians 5:9
%
For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each of us 
may receive what is due us for the things done while in the body, whether good 
or bad.
	--2 Corinthians 5:10
%
Since, then, we know what it is to fear the Lord, we try to persuade others. 
What we are is plain to God, and I hope it is also plain to your conscience.
	--2 Corinthians 5:11
%
We are not trying to commend ourselves to you again, but are giving you an 
opportunity to take pride in us, so that you can answer those who take pride in 
what is seen rather than in what is in the heart.
	--2 Corinthians 5:12
%
If we are “out of our mind,” as some say, it is for God; if we are in our 
right mind, it is for you.
	--2 Corinthians 5:13
%
For Christ’s love compels us, because we are convinced that one died for all, 
and therefore all died.
	--2 Corinthians 5:14
%
And he died for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves 
but for him who died for them and was raised again.
	--2 Corinthians 5:15
%
So from now on we regard no one from a worldly point of view. Though we once 
regarded Christ in this way, we do so no longer.
	--2 Corinthians 5:16
%
Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, 
the new is here!
	--2 Corinthians 5:17
%
All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us 
the ministry of reconciliation:
	--2 Corinthians 5:18
%
that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting 
people’s sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of 
reconciliation.
	--2 Corinthians 5:19
%
We are therefore Christ’s ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal 
through us. We implore you on Christ’s behalf: Be reconciled to God.
	--2 Corinthians 5:20
%
God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become 
the righteousness of God.
	--2 Corinthians 5:21
%
As God’s co-workers we urge you not to receive God’s grace in vain.
	--2 Corinthians 6:1
%
For he says, “In the time of my favor I heard you, and in the day of 
salvation I helped you.” I tell you, now is the time of God’s favor, now is 
the day of salvation.
	--2 Corinthians 6:2
%
We put no stumbling block in anyone’s path, so that our ministry will not be 
discredited.
	--2 Corinthians 6:3
%
Rather, as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way: in great 
endurance; in troubles, hardships and distresses;
	--2 Corinthians 6:4
%
in beatings, imprisonments and riots; in hard work, sleepless nights and hunger;
	--2 Corinthians 6:5
%
in purity, understanding, patience and kindness; in the Holy Spirit and in 
sincere love;
	--2 Corinthians 6:6
%
in truthful speech and in the power of God; with weapons of righteousness in 
the right hand and in the left;
	--2 Corinthians 6:7
%
through glory and dishonor, bad report and good report; genuine, yet regarded 
as impostors;
	--2 Corinthians 6:8
%
known, yet regarded as unknown; dying, and yet we live on; beaten, and yet not 
killed;
	--2 Corinthians 6:9
%
sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; poor, yet making many rich; having nothing, 
and yet possessing everything.
	--2 Corinthians 6:10
%
We have spoken freely to you, Corinthians, and opened wide our hearts to you.
	--2 Corinthians 6:11
%
We are not withholding our affection from you, but you are withholding yours 
from us.
	--2 Corinthians 6:12
%
As a fair exchange—I speak as to my children—open wide your hearts also.
	--2 Corinthians 6:13
%
Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and 
wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness?
	--2 Corinthians 6:14
%
What harmony is there between Christ and Belial? Or what does a believer have 
in common with an unbeliever?
	--2 Corinthians 6:15
%
What agreement is there between the temple of God and idols? For we are the 
temple of the living God. As God has said: “I will live with them and walk 
among them, and I will be their God, and they will be my people.”
	--2 Corinthians 6:16
%
Therefore, “Come out from them and be separate, says the Lord. Touch no 
unclean thing, and I will receive you.”
	--2 Corinthians 6:17
%
And, “I will be a Father to you, and you will be my sons and daughters, says 
the Lord Almighty.”
	--2 Corinthians 6:18
%
Therefore, since we have these promises, dear friends, let us purify ourselves 
from everything that contaminates body and spirit, perfecting holiness out of 
reverence for God.
	--2 Corinthians 7:1
%
Make room for us in your hearts. We have wronged no one, we have corrupted no 
one, we have exploited no one.
	--2 Corinthians 7:2
%
I do not say this to condemn you; I have said before that you have such a place 
in our hearts that we would live or die with you.
	--2 Corinthians 7:3
%
I have spoken to you with great frankness; I take great pride in you. I am 
greatly encouraged; in all our troubles my joy knows no bounds.
	--2 Corinthians 7:4
%
For when we came into Macedonia, we had no rest, but we were harassed at every 
turn—conflicts on the outside, fears within.
	--2 Corinthians 7:5
%
But God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us by the coming of Titus,
	--2 Corinthians 7:6
%
and not only by his coming but also by the comfort you had given him. He told 
us about your longing for me, your deep sorrow, your ardent concern for me, so 
that my joy was greater than ever.
	--2 Corinthians 7:7
%
Even if I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it. Though I did 
regret it—I see that my letter hurt you, but only for a little while—
	--2 Corinthians 7:8
%
yet now I am happy, not because you were made sorry, but because your sorrow 
led you to repentance. For you became sorrowful as God intended and so were not 
harmed in any way by us.
	--2 Corinthians 7:9
%
Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret, 
but worldly sorrow brings death.
	--2 Corinthians 7:10
%
See what this godly sorrow has produced in you: what earnestness, what 
eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation, what alarm, what longing, what 
concern, what readiness to see justice done. At every point you have proved 
yourselves to be innocent in this matter.
	--2 Corinthians 7:11
%
So even though I wrote to you, it was neither on account of the one who did the 
wrong nor on account of the injured party, but rather that before God you could 
see for yourselves how devoted to us you are.
	--2 Corinthians 7:12
%
By all this we are encouraged. In addition to our own encouragement, we were 
especially delighted to see how happy Titus was, because his spirit has been 
refreshed by all of you.
	--2 Corinthians 7:13
%
I had boasted to him about you, and you have not embarrassed me. But just as 
everything we said to you was true, so our boasting about you to Titus has 
proved to be true as well.
	--2 Corinthians 7:14
%
And his affection for you is all the greater when he remembers that you were 
all obedient, receiving him with fear and trembling.
	--2 Corinthians 7:15
%
I am glad I can have complete confidence in you.
	--2 Corinthians 7:16
%
And now, brothers and sisters, we want you to know about the grace that God has 
given the Macedonian churches.
	--2 Corinthians 8:1
%
In the midst of a very severe trial, their overflowing joy and their extreme 
poverty welled up in rich generosity.
	--2 Corinthians 8:2
%
For I testify that they gave as much as they were able, and even beyond their 
ability. Entirely on their own,
	--2 Corinthians 8:3
%
they urgently pleaded with us for the privilege of sharing in this service to 
the Lord’s people.
	--2 Corinthians 8:4
%
And they exceeded our expectations: They gave themselves first of all to the 
Lord, and then by the will of God also to us.
	--2 Corinthians 8:5
%
So we urged Titus, just as he had earlier made a beginning, to bring also to 
completion this act of grace on your part.
	--2 Corinthians 8:6
%
But since you excel in everything—in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in 
complete earnestness and in the love we have kindled in you—see that you also 
excel in this grace of giving.
	--2 Corinthians 8:7
%
I am not commanding you, but I want to test the sincerity of your love by 
comparing it with the earnestness of others.
	--2 Corinthians 8:8
%
For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet 
for your sake he became poor, so that you through his poverty might become rich.
	--2 Corinthians 8:9
%
And here is my judgment about what is best for you in this matter. Last year 
you were the first not only to give but also to have the desire to do so.
	--2 Corinthians 8:10
%
Now finish the work, so that your eager willingness to do it may be matched by 
your completion of it, according to your means.
	--2 Corinthians 8:11
%
For if the willingness is there, the gift is acceptable according to what one 
has, not according to what one does not have.
	--2 Corinthians 8:12
%
Our desire is not that others might be relieved while you are hard pressed, but 
that there might be equality.
	--2 Corinthians 8:13
%
At the present time your plenty will supply what they need, so that in turn 
their plenty will supply what you need. The goal is equality,
	--2 Corinthians 8:14
%
as it is written: “The one who gathered much did not have too much, and the 
one who gathered little did not have too little.”
	--2 Corinthians 8:15
%
Thanks be to God, who put into the heart of Titus the same concern I have for 
you.
	--2 Corinthians 8:16
%
For Titus not only welcomed our appeal, but he is coming to you with much 
enthusiasm and on his own initiative.
	--2 Corinthians 8:17
%
And we are sending along with him the brother who is praised by all the 
churches for his service to the gospel.
	--2 Corinthians 8:18
%
What is more, he was chosen by the churches to accompany us as we carry the 
offering, which we administer in order to honor the Lord himself and to show 
our eagerness to help.
	--2 Corinthians 8:19
%
We want to avoid any criticism of the way we administer this liberal gift.
	--2 Corinthians 8:20
%
For we are taking pains to do what is right, not only in the eyes of the Lord 
but also in the eyes of man.
	--2 Corinthians 8:21
%
In addition, we are sending with them our brother who has often proved to us in 
many ways that he is zealous, and now even more so because of his great 
confidence in you.
	--2 Corinthians 8:22
%
As for Titus, he is my partner and co-worker among you; as for our brothers, 
they are representatives of the churches and an honor to Christ.
	--2 Corinthians 8:23
%
Therefore show these men the proof of your love and the reason for our pride in 
you, so that the churches can see it.
	--2 Corinthians 8:24
%
There is no need for me to write to you about this service to the Lord’s 
people.
	--2 Corinthians 9:1
%
For I know your eagerness to help, and I have been boasting about it to the 
Macedonians, telling them that since last year you in Achaia were ready to 
give; and your enthusiasm has stirred most of them to action.
	--2 Corinthians 9:2
%
But I am sending the brothers in order that our boasting about you in this 
matter should not prove hollow, but that you may be ready, as I said you would 
be.
	--2 Corinthians 9:3
%
For if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we—not to say 
anything about you—would be ashamed of having been so confident.
	--2 Corinthians 9:4
%
So I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to visit you in advance and 
finish the arrangements for the generous gift you had promised. Then it will be 
ready as a generous gift, not as one grudgingly given.
	--2 Corinthians 9:5
%
Remember this: Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever 
sows generously will also reap generously.
	--2 Corinthians 9:6
%
Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not 
reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.
	--2 Corinthians 9:7
%
And God is able to bless you abundantly, so that in all things at all times, 
having all that you need, you will abound in every good work.
	--2 Corinthians 9:8
%
As it is written: “They have freely scattered their gifts to the poor; their 
righteousness endures forever.”
	--2 Corinthians 9:9
%
Now he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will also supply and 
increase your store of seed and will enlarge the harvest of your righteousness.
	--2 Corinthians 9:10
%
You will be enriched in every way so that you can be generous on every 
occasion, and through us your generosity will result in thanksgiving to God.
	--2 Corinthians 9:11
%
This service that you perform is not only supplying the needs of the Lord’s 
people but is also overflowing in many expressions of thanks to God.
	--2 Corinthians 9:12
%
Because of the service by which you have proved yourselves, others will praise 
God for the obedience that accompanies your confession of the gospel of Christ, 
and for your generosity in sharing with them and with everyone else.
	--2 Corinthians 9:13
%
And in their prayers for you their hearts will go out to you, because of the 
surpassing grace God has given you.
	--2 Corinthians 9:14
%
Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift!
	--2 Corinthians 9:15
%
By the humility and gentleness of Christ, I appeal to you—I, Paul, who am 
“timid” when face to face with you, but “bold” toward you when away!
	--2 Corinthians 10:1
%
I beg you that when I come I may not have to be as bold as I expect to be 
toward some people who think that we live by the standards of this world.
	--2 Corinthians 10:2
%
For though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does.
	--2 Corinthians 10:3
%
The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world. On the contrary, 
they have divine power to demolish strongholds.
	--2 Corinthians 10:4
%
We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the 
knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to 
Christ.
	--2 Corinthians 10:5
%
And we will be ready to punish every act of disobedience, once your obedience 
is complete.
	--2 Corinthians 10:6
%
You are judging by appearances. If anyone is confident that they belong to 
Christ, they should consider again that we belong to Christ just as much as 
they do.
	--2 Corinthians 10:7
%
So even if I boast somewhat freely about the authority the Lord gave us for 
building you up rather than tearing you down, I will not be ashamed of it.
	--2 Corinthians 10:8
%
I do not want to seem to be trying to frighten you with my letters.
	--2 Corinthians 10:9
%
For some say, “His letters are weighty and forceful, but in person he is 
unimpressive and his speaking amounts to nothing.”
	--2 Corinthians 10:10
%
Such people should realize that what we are in our letters when we are absent, 
we will be in our actions when we are present.
	--2 Corinthians 10:11
%
We do not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some who commend 
themselves. When they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves 
with themselves, they are not wise.
	--2 Corinthians 10:12
%
We, however, will not boast beyond proper limits, but will confine our boasting 
to the sphere of service God himself has assigned to us, a sphere that also 
includes you.
	--2 Corinthians 10:13
%
We are not going too far in our boasting, as would be the case if we had not 
come to you, for we did get as far as you with the gospel of Christ.
	--2 Corinthians 10:14
%
Neither do we go beyond our limits by boasting of work done by others. Our hope 
is that, as your faith continues to grow, our sphere of activity among you will 
greatly expand,
	--2 Corinthians 10:15
%
so that we can preach the gospel in the regions beyond you. For we do not want 
to boast about work already done in someone else’s territory.
	--2 Corinthians 10:16
%
But, “Let the one who boasts boast in the Lord.”
	--2 Corinthians 10:17
%
For it is not the one who commends himself who is approved, but the one whom 
the Lord commends.
	--2 Corinthians 10:18
%
I hope you will put up with me in a little foolishness. Yes, please put up with 
me!
	--2 Corinthians 11:1
%
I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy. I promised you to one husband, to 
Christ, so that I might present you as a pure virgin to him.
	--2 Corinthians 11:2
%
But I am afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the serpent’s cunning, your 
minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ.
	--2 Corinthians 11:3
%
For if someone comes to you and preaches a Jesus other than the Jesus we 
preached, or if you receive a different spirit from the Spirit you received, or 
a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it easily enough.
	--2 Corinthians 11:4
%
I do not think I am in the least inferior to those “super-apostles.”
	--2 Corinthians 11:5
%
I may indeed be untrained as a speaker, but I do have knowledge. We have made 
this perfectly clear to you in every way.
	--2 Corinthians 11:6
%
Was it a sin for me to lower myself in order to elevate you by preaching the 
gospel of God to you free of charge?
	--2 Corinthians 11:7
%
I robbed other churches by receiving support from them so as to serve you.
	--2 Corinthians 11:8
%
And when I was with you and needed something, I was not a burden to anyone, for 
the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied what I needed. I have kept myself 
from being a burden to you in any way, and will continue to do so.
	--2 Corinthians 11:9
%
As surely as the truth of Christ is in me, nobody in the regions of Achaia will 
stop this boasting of mine.
	--2 Corinthians 11:10
%
Why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do!
	--2 Corinthians 11:11
%
And I will keep on doing what I am doing in order to cut the ground from under 
those who want an opportunity to be considered equal with us in the things they 
boast about.
	--2 Corinthians 11:12
%
For such people are false apostles, deceitful workers, masquerading as apostles 
of Christ.
	--2 Corinthians 11:13
%
And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light.
	--2 Corinthians 11:14
%
It is not surprising, then, if his servants also masquerade as servants of 
righteousness. Their end will be what their actions deserve.
	--2 Corinthians 11:15
%
I repeat: Let no one take me for a fool. But if you do, then tolerate me just 
as you would a fool, so that I may do a little boasting.
	--2 Corinthians 11:16
%
In this self-confident boasting I am not talking as the Lord would, but as a 
fool.
	--2 Corinthians 11:17
%
Since many are boasting in the way the world does, I too will boast.
	--2 Corinthians 11:18
%
You gladly put up with fools since you are so wise!
	--2 Corinthians 11:19
%
In fact, you even put up with anyone who enslaves you or exploits you or takes 
advantage of you or puts on airs or slaps you in the face.

To my shame I admit that we were too weak for that! Whatever anyone else dares 
to boast about—I am speaking as a fool—I also dare to boast about.

Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they Abraham’s 
descendants? So am I.

Are they servants of Christ? (I am out of my mind to talk like this.) I am 
more. I have worked much harder, been in prison more frequently, been flogged 
more severely, and been exposed to death again and again.

Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one.

Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was pelted with stones, three times 
I was shipwrecked, I spent a night and a day in the open sea,

I have been constantly on the move. I have been in danger from rivers, in 
danger from bandits, in danger from my fellow Jews, in danger from Gentiles; in 
danger in the city, in danger in the country, in danger at sea; and in danger 
from false believers.

I have labored and toiled and have often gone without sleep; I have known 
hunger and thirst and have often gone without food; I have been cold and naked.

Besides everything else, I face daily the pressure of my concern for all the 
churches.

burn?

If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness.

The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, who is to be praised forever, knows that 
I am not lying.

In Damascus the governor under King Aretas had the city of the Damascenes 
guarded in order to arrest me.
	--2 Corinthians 11:32
%
But I was lowered in a basket from a window in the wall and slipped through his 
hands.
	--2 Corinthians 11:33

I must go on boasting. Although there is nothing to be gained, I will go on to 
visions and revelations from the Lord.
	--2 Corinthians 12:1
%
I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third 
heaven. Whether it was in the body or out of the body I do not know—God knows.
	--2 Corinthians 12:2
%
And I know that this man—whether in the body or apart from the body I do not 
know, but God knows—
	--2 Corinthians 12:3
%
was caught up to paradise and heard inexpressible things, things that no one is 
permitted to tell.
	--2 Corinthians 12:4
%
I will boast about a man like that, but I will not boast about myself, except 
about my weaknesses.
	--2 Corinthians 12:5
%
Even if I should choose to boast, I would not be a fool, because I would be 
speaking the truth. But I refrain, so no one will think more of me than is 
warranted by what I do or say,
	--2 Corinthians 12:6
%
or because of these surpassingly great revelations. Therefore, in order to keep 
me from becoming conceited, I was given a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of 
Satan, to torment me.
	--2 Corinthians 12:7
%
Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me.
	--2 Corinthians 12:8
%
But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made 
perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my 
weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may rest on me.
	--2 Corinthians 12:9
%
That is why, for Christ’s sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in 
hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am 
strong.
	--2 Corinthians 12:10
%
I have made a fool of myself, but you drove me to it. I ought to have been 
commended by you, for I am not in the least inferior to the 
“super-apostles,” even though I am nothing.
	--2 Corinthians 12:11
%
I persevered in demonstrating among you the marks of a true apostle, including 
signs, wonders and miracles.
	--2 Corinthians 12:12
%
How were you inferior to the other churches, except that I was never a burden 
to you? Forgive me this wrong!
	--2 Corinthians 12:13
%
Now I am ready to visit you for the third time, and I will not be a burden to 
you, because what I want is not your possessions but you. After all, children 
should not have to save up for their parents, but parents for their children.
	--2 Corinthians 12:14
%
So I will very gladly spend for you everything I have and expend myself as 
well. If I love you more, will you love me less?
	--2 Corinthians 12:15
%
Be that as it may, I have not been a burden to you. Yet, crafty fellow that I 
am, I caught you by trickery!
	--2 Corinthians 12:16
%
Did I exploit you through any of the men I sent to you?
	--2 Corinthians 12:17
%
I urged Titus to go to you and I sent our brother with him. Titus did not 
exploit you, did he? Did we not walk in the same footsteps by the same Spirit?

%
Have you been thinking all along that we have been defending ourselves to you? 
We have been speaking in the sight of God as those in Christ; and everything we 
do, dear friends, is for your strengthening.
	--2 Corinthians 12:19
%
For I am afraid that when I come I may not find you as I want you to be, and 
you may not find me as you want me to be. I fear that there may be discord, 
jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, slander, gossip, arrogance and 
disorder.
	--2 Corinthians 12:20
%
I am afraid that when I come again my God will humble me before you, and I will 
be grieved over many who have sinned earlier and have not repented of the 
impurity, sexual sin and debauchery in which they have indulged.
	--2 Corinthians 12:21
%
This will be my third visit to you. “Every matter must be established by the 
testimony of two or three witnesses.”
	--2 Corinthians 13:1
%
I already gave you a warning when I was with you the second time. I now repeat 
it while absent: On my return I will not spare those who sinned earlier or any 
of the others,
	--2 Corinthians 13:2
%
since you are demanding proof that Christ is speaking through me. He is not 
weak in dealing with you, but is powerful among you.
	--2 Corinthians 13:3
%
For to be sure, he was crucified in weakness, yet he lives by God’s power. 
Likewise, we are weak in him, yet by God’s power we will live with him in our 
dealing with you.
	--2 Corinthians 13:4
%
Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves. Do you 
not realize that Christ Jesus is in you—unless, of course, you fail the test?
	--2 Corinthians 13:5
%
And I trust that you will discover that we have not failed the test.
	--2 Corinthians 13:6
%
Now we pray to God that you will not do anything wrong—not so that people 
will see that we have stood the test but so that you will do what is right even 
though we may seem to have failed.
	--2 Corinthians 13:7
%
For we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth.
	--2 Corinthians 13:8
%
We are glad whenever we are weak but you are strong; and our prayer is that you 
may be fully restored.
	--2 Corinthians 13:9
%
This is why I write these things when I am absent, that when I come I may not 
have to be harsh in my use of authority—the authority the Lord gave me for 
building you up, not for tearing you down.
	--2 Corinthians 13:10
%
Finally, brothers and sisters, rejoice! Strive for full restoration, encourage 
one another, be of one mind, live in peace. And the God of love and peace will 
be with you.

The elder, To the lady chosen by God and to her children, whom I love in the 
truth—and not I only, but also all who know the truth—
	 --2 John 1:1

because of the truth, which lives in us and will be with us forever:
	 --2 John 1:2
%
Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the 
Father’s Son, will be with us in truth and love.
	 --2 John 1:3
%
It has given me great joy to find some of your children walking in the truth, 
just as the Father commanded us.
	 --2 John 1:4
%
And now, dear lady, I am not writing you a new command but one we have had from 
the beginning. I ask that we love one another.
	 --2 John 1:5
%
And this is love: that we walk in obedience to his commands. As you have heard 
from the beginning, his command is that you walk in love.
	 --2 John 1:6
%
I say this because many deceivers, who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as 
coming in the flesh, have gone out into the world. Any such person is the 
deceiver and the antichrist.

Watch out that you do not lose what we have worked for, but that you may be 
rewarded fully.

If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not take them into 
your house or welcome them.
	 --2 John 1:10

Anyone who welcomes them shares in their wicked work.

%Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who through the 
righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ have received a faith as 
precious as ours:
	 --2 Peter 1:1
%
Grace and peace be yours in abundance through the knowledge of God and of Jesus 
our Lord.
	 --2 Peter 1:2
%
His divine power has given us everything we need for a godly life through our 
knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness.
	 --2 Peter 1:3
%
Through these he has given us his very great and precious promises, so that 
through them you may participate in the divine nature, having escaped the 
corruption in the world caused by evil desires.
	 --2 Peter 1:4
%
For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith goodness; and to 
goodness, knowledge;
	 --2 Peter 1:5
%
and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to 
perseverance, godliness;
	 --2 Peter 1:6
%
and to godliness, mutual affection; and to mutual affection, love.
	 --2 Peter 1:7
%
For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you 
from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus 
Christ.
	 --2 Peter 1:8
%
But whoever does not have them is nearsighted and blind, forgetting that they 
have been cleansed from their past sins.
	 --2 Peter 1:9
%
Therefore, my brothers and sisters, make every effort to confirm your calling 
and election. For if you do these things, you will never stumble,
	 --2 Peter 1:10
%
and you will receive a rich welcome into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and 
Savior Jesus Christ.
	 --2 Peter 1:11
%
So I will always remind you of these things, even though you know them and are 
firmly established in the truth you now have.
	 --2 Peter 1:12
%
I think it is right to refresh your memory as long as I live in the tent of 
this body,
	 --2 Peter 1:13
%
because I know that I will soon put it aside, as our Lord Jesus Christ has made 
clear to me.
	 --2 Peter 1:14
%
And I will make every effort to see that after my departure you will always be 
able to remember these things.
	 --2 Peter 1:15
%
For we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we told you about the 
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in power, but we were eyewitnesses of his 
majesty.
	 --2 Peter 1:16
%
He received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice came to him from 
the Majestic Glory, saying, “This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well 
pleased.”
	 --2 Peter 1:17
%
We ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven when we were with him on 
the sacred mountain.
	 --2 Peter 1:18
%
We also have the prophetic message as something completely reliable, and you 
will do well to pay attention to it, as to a light shining in a dark place, 
until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.
	 --2 Peter 1:19
%
Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the 
prophet’s own interpretation of things.
	 --2 Peter 1:20
%
For prophecy never had its origin in the human will, but prophets, though 
human, spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.
	 --2 Peter 1:21
%
But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be 
false teachers among you. They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, 
even denying the sovereign Lord who bought them—bringing swift destruction on 
themselves.
	 --2 Peter 2:1
%
Many will follow their depraved conduct and will bring the way of truth into 
disrepute.
	 --2 Peter 2:2
%
In their greed these teachers will exploit you with fabricated stories. Their 
condemnation has long been hanging over them, and their destruction has not 
been sleeping.
	 --2 Peter 2:3
%
For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but sent them to hell, 
putting them in chains of darkness to be held for judgment;
	 --2 Peter 2:4
%
if he did not spare the ancient world when he brought the flood on its ungodly 
people, but protected Noah, a preacher of righteousness, and seven others;
	 --2 Peter 2:5
%
if he condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah by burning them to ashes, and 
made them an example of what is going to happen to the ungodly;
	 --2 Peter 2:6
%
and if he rescued Lot, a righteous man, who was distressed by the depraved 
conduct of the lawless
	 --2 Peter 2:7
%
(for that righteous man, living among them day after day, was tormented in his 
righteous soul by the lawless deeds he saw and heard)—
	 --2 Peter 2:8
%
if this is so, then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials and to 
hold the unrighteous for punishment on the day of judgment.
	 --2 Peter 2:9
%
This is especially true of those who follow the corrupt desire of the flesh and 
despise authority. Bold and arrogant, they are not afraid to heap abuse on 
celestial beings;
	 --2 Peter 2:10
%
yet even angels, although they are stronger and more powerful, do not heap 
abuse on such beings when bringing judgment on them from the Lord.
	 --2 Peter 2:11
%
But these people blaspheme in matters they do not understand. They are like 
unreasoning animals, creatures of instinct, born only to be caught and 
destroyed, and like animals they too will perish.
	 --2 Peter 2:12
%
They will be paid back with harm for the harm they have done. Their idea of 
pleasure is to carouse in broad daylight. They are blots and blemishes, 
reveling in their pleasures while they feast with you.
	 --2 Peter 2:13
%
With eyes full of adultery, they never stop sinning; they seduce the unstable; 
they are experts in greed—an accursed brood!
	 --2 Peter 2:14
%
They have left the straight way and wandered off to follow the way of Balaam 
son of Bezer, who loved the wages of wickedness.
	 --2 Peter 2:15
%
But he was rebuked for his wrongdoing by a donkey—an animal without 
speech—who spoke with a human voice and restrained the prophet’s madness.
	 --2 Peter 2:16
%
These people are springs without water and mists driven by a storm. Blackest 
darkness is reserved for them.
	 --2 Peter 2:17
%
For they mouth empty, boastful words and, by appealing to the lustful desires 
of the flesh, they entice people who are just escaping from those who live in 
error.
	 --2 Peter 2:18
%
They promise them freedom, while they themselves are slaves of depravity—for 
“people are slaves to whatever has mastered them.”
	 --2 Peter 2:19
%
If they have escaped the corruption of the world by knowing our Lord and Savior 
Jesus Christ and are again entangled in it and are overcome, they are worse off 
at the end than they were at the beginning.
	 --2 Peter 2:20
%
It would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, 
than to have known it and then to turn their backs on the sacred command that 
was passed on to them.
	 --2 Peter 2:21
%
Of them the proverbs are true: “A dog returns to its vomit,” and, “A sow 
that is washed returns to her wallowing in the mud.”
	 --2 Peter 2:22
%
Dear friends, this is now my second letter to you. I have written both of them 
as reminders to stimulate you to wholesome thinking.
	 --2 Peter 3:1
%
I want you to recall the words spoken in the past by the holy prophets and the 
command given by our Lord and Savior through your apostles.
	 --2 Peter 3:2
%
Above all, you must understand that in the last days scoffers will come, 
scoffing and following their own evil desires.
	 --2 Peter 3:3
%
They will say, “Where is this ‘coming’ he promised? Ever since our 
ancestors died, everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation.”
	 --2 Peter 3:4
%
But they deliberately forget that long ago by God’s word the heavens came 
into being and the earth was formed out of water and by water.
	 --2 Peter 3:5
%
By these waters also the world of that time was deluged and destroyed.
	 --2 Peter 3:6
%
By the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being 
kept for the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly.
	 --2 Peter 3:7
%
But do not forget this one thing, dear friends: With the Lord a day is like a 
thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day.
	 --2 Peter 3:8
%
The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. 
Instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to 
come to repentance.
	 --2 Peter 3:9
%
But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will disappear with 
a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the earth and everything 
done in it will be laid bare.
	 --2 Peter 3:10
%
Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you 
to be? You ought to live holy and godly lives
	 --2 Peter 3:11
%
as you look forward to the day of God and speed its coming. That day will bring 
about the destruction of the heavens by fire, and the elements will melt in the 
heat.
	 --2 Peter 3:12
%
But in keeping with his promise we are looking forward to a new heaven and a 
new earth, where righteousness dwells.
	 --2 Peter 3:13
%
So then, dear friends, since you are looking forward to this, make every effort 
to be found spotless, blameless and at peace with him.
	 --2 Peter 3:14
%
Bear in mind that our Lord’s patience means salvation, just as our dear 
brother Paul also wrote you with the wisdom that God gave him.
	 --2 Peter 3:15
%
He writes the same way in all his letters, speaking in them of these matters. 
His letters contain some things that are hard to understand, which ignorant and 
unstable people distort, as they do the other Scriptures, to their own 
destruction.
	 --2 Peter 3:16
%
Therefore, dear friends, since you have been forewarned, be on your guard so 
that you may not be carried away by the error of the lawless and fall from your 
secure position.
	 --2 Peter 3:17
%
But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him 
be glory both now and forever! Amen.
	 --2 Peter 3:18
%Paul, Silas and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father 
and the Lord Jesus Christ:
	 --2 Thessalonians 1:1
%
Grace and peace to you from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
	 --2 Thessalonians 1:2
%
We ought always to thank God for you, brothers and sisters, and rightly so, 
because your faith is growing more and more, and the love all of you have for 
one another is increasing.
	 --2 Thessalonians 1:3
%
Therefore, among God’s churches we boast about your perseverance and faith in 
all the persecutions and trials you are enduring.
	 --2 Thessalonians 1:4
%
All this is evidence that God’s judgment is right, and as a result you will 
be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you are suffering.
	 --2 Thessalonians 1:5
%
God is just: He will pay back trouble to those who trouble you
	 --2 Thessalonians 1:6
%
and give relief to you who are troubled, and to us as well. This will happen 
when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful 
angels.
	 --2 Thessalonians 1:7
%
He will punish those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord 
Jesus.
	 --2 Thessalonians 1:8
%
They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the 
presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might
	 --2 Thessalonians 1:9
%
on the day he comes to be glorified in his holy people and to be marveled at 
among all those who have believed. This includes you, because you believed our 
testimony to you.
	 --2 Thessalonians 1:10
%
With this in mind, we constantly pray for you, that our God may make you worthy 
of his calling, and that by his power he may bring to fruition your every 
desire for goodness and your every deed prompted by faith.
	 --2 Thessalonians 1:11
%
We pray this so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and 
you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
	 --2 Thessalonians 1:12
%
Concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered to him, 
we ask you, brothers and sisters,
	 --2 Thessalonians 2:1
%
not to become easily unsettled or alarmed by the teaching allegedly from 
us—whether by a prophecy or by word of mouth or by letter—asserting that 
the day of the Lord has already come.
	 --2 Thessalonians 2:2
%
Don’t let anyone deceive you in any way, for that day will not come until the 
rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the man doomed to 
destruction.
	 --2 Thessalonians 2:3
%
He will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called God or is 
worshiped, so that he sets himself up in God’s temple, proclaiming himself to 
be God.
	 --2 Thessalonians 2:4
%
Don’t you remember that when I was with you I used to tell you these things?
	 --2 Thessalonians 2:5
%
And now you know what is holding him back, so that he may be revealed at the 
proper time.
	 --2 Thessalonians 2:6
%
For the secret power of lawlessness is already at work; but the one who now 
holds it back will continue to do so till he is taken out of the way.
	 --2 Thessalonians 2:7
%
And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will overthrow 
with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the splendor of his coming.
	 --2 Thessalonians 2:8
%
The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with how Satan works. He 
will use all sorts of displays of power through signs and wonders that serve 
the lie,
	 --2 Thessalonians 2:9
%
and all the ways that wickedness deceives those who are perishing. They perish 
because they refused to love the truth and so be saved.
	 --2 Thessalonians 2:10
%
For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe 
the lie
	 --2 Thessalonians 2:11
%
and so that all will be condemned who have not believed the truth but have 
delighted in wickedness.
	 --2 Thessalonians 2:12
%
But we ought always to thank God for you, brothers and sisters loved by the 
Lord, because God chose you as firstfruits to be saved through the sanctifying 
work of the Spirit and through belief in the truth.
	 --2 Thessalonians 2:13
%
He called you to this through our gospel, that you might share in the glory of 
our Lord Jesus Christ.
	 --2 Thessalonians 2:14
%
So then, brothers and sisters, stand firm and hold fast to the teachings we 
passed on to you, whether by word of mouth or by letter.
	 --2 Thessalonians 2:15
%
May our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who loved us and by his 
grace gave us eternal encouragement and good hope,
	 --2 Thessalonians 2:16
%
encourage your hearts and strengthen you in every good deed and word.
	 --2 Thessalonians 2:17
%
As for other matters, brothers and sisters, pray for us that the message of the 
Lord may spread rapidly and be honored, just as it was with you.
	 --2 Thessalonians 3:1
%
And pray that we may be delivered from wicked and evil people, for not everyone 
has faith.
	 --2 Thessalonians 3:2
%
But the Lord is faithful, and he will strengthen you and protect you from the 
evil one.
	 --2 Thessalonians 3:3
%
We have confidence in the Lord that you are doing and will continue to do the 
things we command.
	 --2 Thessalonians 3:4
%
May the Lord direct your hearts into God’s love and Christ’s perseverance.
	 --2 Thessalonians 3:5
%
In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we command you, brothers and sisters, to 
keep away from every believer who is idle and disruptive and does not live 
according to the teaching you received from us.
	 --2 Thessalonians 3:6
%
For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example. We were not idle 
when we were with you,
	 --2 Thessalonians 3:7
%
nor did we eat anyone’s food without paying for it. On the contrary, we 
worked night and day, laboring and toiling so that we would not be a burden to 
any of you.
	 --2 Thessalonians 3:8
%
We did this, not because we do not have the right to such help, but in order to 
offer ourselves as a model for you to imitate.
	 --2 Thessalonians 3:9
%
For even when we were with you, we gave you this rule: “The one who is 
unwilling to work shall not eat.”
	 --2 Thessalonians 3:10
%
We hear that some among you are idle and disruptive. They are not busy; they 
are busybodies.
	 --2 Thessalonians 3:11
%
Such people we command and urge in the Lord Jesus Christ to settle down and 
earn the food they eat.
	 --2 Thessalonians 3:12
%
And as for you, brothers and sisters, never tire of doing what is good.
	 --2 Thessalonians 3:13

Take special note of anyone who does not obey our instruction in this letter. 
Do not associate with them, in order that they may feel ashamed.

Yet do not regard them as an enemy, but warn them as you would a fellow 
believer.

Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times and in every way. 
The Lord be with all of you.

I, Paul, write this greeting in my own hand, which is the distinguishing mark 
in all my letters. This is how I write.

To Timothy, my dear son: Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ 
Jesus our Lord.
	 --2 Timothy 1:2
%
I thank God, whom I serve, as my ancestors did, with a clear conscience, as 
night and day I constantly remember you in my prayers.
	 --2 Timothy 1:3
%
Recalling your tears, I long to see you, so that I may be filled with joy.
	 --2 Timothy 1:4
%
I am reminded of your sincere faith, which first lived in your grandmother Lois 
and in your mother Eunice and, I am persuaded, now lives in you also.
	 --2 Timothy 1:5
%
For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you 
through the laying on of my hands.
	 --2 Timothy 1:6
%
For the Spirit God gave us does not make us timid, but gives us power, love and 
self-discipline.
	 --2 Timothy 1:7
%
So do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord or of me his prisoner. 
Rather, join with me in suffering for the gospel, by the power of God.
	 --2 Timothy 1:8
%
He has saved us and called us to a holy life—not because of anything we have 
done but because of his own purpose and grace. This grace was given us in 
Christ Jesus before the beginning of time,
	 --2 Timothy 1:9
%
but it has now been revealed through the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, 
who has destroyed death and has brought life and immortality to light through 
the gospel.
	 --2 Timothy 1:10
%
And of this gospel I was appointed a herald and an apostle and a teacher.
	 --2 Timothy 1:11
%
That is why I am suffering as I am. Yet this is no cause for shame, because I 
know whom I have believed, and am convinced that he is able to guard what I 
have entrusted to him until that day.
	 --2 Timothy 1:12
%
What you heard from me, keep as the pattern of sound teaching, with faith and 
love in Christ Jesus.
	 --2 Timothy 1:13

Guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you—guard it with the help of 
the Holy Spirit who lives in us.

You know that everyone in the province of Asia has deserted me, including 
Phygelus and Hermogenes.
	 --2 Timothy 1:15
%
May the Lord show mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, because he often 
refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains.
	 --2 Timothy 1:16
%
On the contrary, when he was in Rome, he searched hard for me until he found me.
	 --2 Timothy 1:17
%
May the Lord grant that he will find mercy from the Lord on that day! You know 
very well in how many ways he helped me in Ephesus.
	 --2 Timothy 1:18
%
You then, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
	 --2 Timothy 2:1
%
And the things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust 
to reliable people who will also be qualified to teach others.
	 --2 Timothy 2:2
%
Join with me in suffering, like a good soldier of Christ Jesus.
	 --2 Timothy 2:3
%
No one serving as a soldier gets entangled in civilian affairs, but rather 
tries to please his commanding officer.
	 --2 Timothy 2:4

Similarly, anyone who competes as an athlete does not receive the victor’s 
crown except by competing according to the rules.
	 --2 Timothy 2:5

The hardworking farmer should be the first to receive a share of the crops.
	 --2 Timothy 2:6
%
Reflect on what I am saying, for the Lord will give you insight into all this.
	 --2 Timothy 2:7
%
Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, descended from David. This is my 
gospel,
	 --2 Timothy 2:8
%
for which I am suffering even to the point of being chained like a criminal. 
But God’s word is not chained.
	 --2 Timothy 2:9
%
Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they too may 
obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.
	 --2 Timothy 2:10
%
Here is a trustworthy saying: If we died with him, we will also live with him;
	 --2 Timothy 2:11
%
if we endure, we will also reign with him. If we disown him, he will also 
disown us;
	 --2 Timothy 2:12
%
if we are faithless, he remains faithful, for he cannot disown himself.
	 --2 Timothy 2:13
%
Keep reminding God’s people of these things. Warn them before God against 
quarreling about words; it is of no value, and only ruins those who listen.
	 --2 Timothy 2:14
%
Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who does not 
need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth.
	 --2 Timothy 2:15
%
Avoid godless chatter, because those who indulge in it will become more and 
more ungodly.
	 --2 Timothy 2:16
%
Their teaching will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,
	 --2 Timothy 2:17
%
who have departed from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already 
taken place, and they destroy the faith of some.
	 --2 Timothy 2:18
%
Nevertheless, God’s solid foundation stands firm, sealed with this 
inscription: “The Lord knows those who are his,” and, “Everyone who 
confesses the name of the Lord must turn away from wickedness.”
	 --2 Timothy 2:19

In a large house there are articles not only of gold and silver, but also of 
wood and clay; some are for special purposes and some for common use.
	 --2 Timothy 2:20
%
Those who cleanse themselves from the latter will be instruments for special 
purposes, made holy, useful to the Master and prepared to do any good work.
	 --2 Timothy 2:21
%
Flee the evil desires of youth and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, 
along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.
	 --2 Timothy 2:22
%
Don’t have anything to do with foolish and stupid arguments, because you know 
they produce quarrels.
	 --2 Timothy 2:23
%
And the Lord’s servant must not be quarrelsome but must be kind to everyone, 
able to teach, not resentful.
	 --2 Timothy 2:24
%
Opponents must be gently instructed, in the hope that God will grant them 
repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth,
	 --2 Timothy 2:25
%
and that they will come to their senses and escape from the trap of the devil, 
who has taken them captive to do his will.
	 --2 Timothy 2:26
%
But mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days.
	 --2 Timothy 3:1
%
People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, 
disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy,
	 --2 Timothy 3:2
%
without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers 
of the good,
	 --2 Timothy 3:3
%
treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God—
	 --2 Timothy 3:4
%
having a form of godliness but denying its power. Have nothing to do with such 
people.
	 --2 Timothy 3:5
%
They are the kind who worm their way into homes and gain control over gullible 
women, who are loaded down with sins and are swayed by all kinds of evil 
desires,
	 --2 Timothy 3:6
%
always learning but never able to come to a knowledge of the truth.
	 --2 Timothy 3:7
%
Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so also these teachers oppose the 
truth. They are men of depraved minds, who, as far as the faith is concerned, 
are rejected.
	 --2 Timothy 3:8
%
But they will not get very far because, as in the case of those men, their 
folly will be clear to everyone.
	 --2 Timothy 3:9
%
You, however, know all about my teaching, my way of life, my purpose, faith, 
patience, love, endurance,
	 --2 Timothy 3:10
%
persecutions, sufferings—what kinds of things happened to me in Antioch, 
Iconium and Lystra, the persecutions I endured. Yet the Lord rescued me from 
all of them.
	 --2 Timothy 3:11
%
In fact, everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be 
persecuted,
	 --2 Timothy 3:12
%
while evildoers and impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving and being 
deceived.
	 --2 Timothy 3:13
%
But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have become convinced of, 
because you know those from whom you learned it,
	 --2 Timothy 3:14
%
and how from infancy you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make 
you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.
	 --2 Timothy 3:15
%
All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting 
and training in righteousness,
	 --2 Timothy 3:16
%
so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.
	 --2 Timothy 3:17
%
In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the 
dead, and in view of his appearing and his kingdom, I give you this charge:
	 --2 Timothy 4:1
%
Preach the word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and 
encourage—with great patience and careful instruction.
	 --2 Timothy 4:2
%
For the time will come when people will not put up with sound doctrine. 
Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number 
of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear.
	 --2 Timothy 4:3
%
They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths.
	 --2 Timothy 4:4
%
But you, keep your head in all situations, endure hardship, do the work of an 
evangelist, discharge all the duties of your ministry.
	 --2 Timothy 4:5
%
For I am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the time for my 
departure is near.
	 --2 Timothy 4:6
%
I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.
	 --2 Timothy 4:7
%
Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the 
righteous Judge, will award to me on that day—and not only to me, but also to 
all who have longed for his appearing.
	 --2 Timothy 4:8
%
Do your best to come to me quickly,
	 --2 Timothy 4:9

for Demas, because he loved this world, has deserted me and has gone to 
Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.
	 --2 Timothy 4:10

Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, because he is helpful to 
me in my ministry.
	 --2 Timothy 4:11

I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.

%
When you come, bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas, and my 
scrolls, especially the parchments.
	 --2 Timothy 4:13
%
Alexander the metalworker did me a great deal of harm. The Lord will repay him 
for what he has done.
	 --2 Timothy 4:14
%
You too should be on your guard against him, because he strongly opposed our 
message.
	 --2 Timothy 4:15
%
At my first defense, no one came to my support, but everyone deserted me. May 
it not be held against them.
	 --2 Timothy 4:16
%
But the Lord stood at my side and gave me strength, so that through me the 
message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. And I was 
delivered from the lion’s mouth.
	 --2 Timothy 4:17

The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack and will bring me safely to his 
heavenly kingdom. To him be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

Dear friend, I pray that you may enjoy good health and that all may go well 
with you, even as your soul is getting along well.
	 --3 John 1:2

It gave me great joy when some believers came and testified about your 
faithfulness to the truth, telling how you continue to walk in it.
	 --3 John 1:3
%
I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in the truth.
	 --3 John 1:4
%
Dear friend, you are faithful in what you are doing for the brothers and 
sisters, even though they are strangers to you.
	 --3 John 1:5
%
They have told the church about your love. Please send them on their way in a 
manner that honors God.
	 --3 John 1:6
%
It was for the sake of the Name that they went out, receiving no help from the 
pagans.
	 --3 John 1:7
%
We ought therefore to show hospitality to such people so that we may work 
together for the truth.
	 --3 John 1:8
%
I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to be first, will not welcome 
us.
	 --3 John 1:9
%
So when I come, I will call attention to what he is doing, spreading malicious 
nonsense about us. Not satisfied with that, he even refuses to welcome other 
believers. He also stops those who want to do so and puts them out of the 
church.
	 --3 John 1:10
%
Dear friend, do not imitate what is evil but what is good. Anyone who does what 
is good is from God. Anyone who does what is evil has not seen God.
	 --3 John 1:11
%
Demetrius is well spoken of by everyone—and even by the truth itself. We also 
speak well of him, and you know that our testimony is true.
	 --3 John 1:12

I have much to write you, but I do not want to do so with pen and ink.
	 --3 John 1:13
%
I hope to see you soon, and we will talk face to face. Peace to you. The 
friends here send their greetings. Greet the friends there by name.
	 --3 John 1:14
%In my former book, Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and to 
teach
	--Acts 1:1
%
until the day he was taken up to heaven, after giving instructions through the 
Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen.
	--Acts 1:2
%
After his suffering, he presented himself to them and gave many convincing 
proofs that he was alive. He appeared to them over a period of forty days and 
spoke about the kingdom of God.
	--Acts 1:3
%
On one occasion, while he was eating with them, he gave them this command: 
“Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my Father promised, which you 
have heard me speak about.
	--Acts 1:4
%
For John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the 
Holy Spirit.”
	--Acts 1:5
%
Then they gathered around him and asked him, “Lord, are you at this time 
going to restore the kingdom to Israel?”
	--Acts 1:6
%
He said to them: “It is not for you to know the times or dates the Father has 
set by his own authority.
	--Acts 1:7
%
But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be 
my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the 
earth.”
	--Acts 1:8
%
After he said this, he was taken up before their very eyes, and a cloud hid him 
from their sight.
	--Acts 1:9
%
They were looking intently up into the sky as he was going, when suddenly two 
men dressed in white stood beside them.
	--Acts 1:10
%
“Men of Galilee,” they said, “why do you stand here looking into the sky? 
This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the 
same way you have seen him go into heaven.”
	--Acts 1:11
%
Then the apostles returned to Jerusalem from the hill called the Mount of 
Olives, a Sabbath day’s walk from the city.
	--Acts 1:12
%
When they arrived, they went upstairs to the room where they were staying. 
Those present were Peter, John, James and Andrew; Philip and Thomas, 
Bartholomew and Matthew; James son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot, and Judas 
son of James.
	--Acts 1:13
%
They all joined together constantly in prayer, along with the women and Mary 
the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.
	--Acts 1:14
%
In those days Peter stood up among the believers (a group numbering about a 
hundred and twenty)
	--Acts 1:15
%
and said, “Brothers and sisters, the Scripture had to be fulfilled in which 
the Holy Spirit spoke long ago through David concerning Judas, who served as 
guide for those who arrested Jesus.
	--Acts 1:16
%
He was one of our number and shared in our ministry.”
	--Acts 1:17
%
(With the payment he received for his wickedness, Judas bought a field; there 
he fell headlong, his body burst open and all his intestines spilled out.
	--Acts 1:18
%
Everyone in Jerusalem heard about this, so they called that field in their 
language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.)
	--Acts 1:19
%
“For,” said Peter, “it is written in the Book of Psalms: “‘May his 
place be deserted; let there be no one to dwell in it,’ and, “‘May 
another take his place of leadership.’
	--Acts 1:20
%
Therefore it is necessary to choose one of the men who have been with us the 
whole time the Lord Jesus was living among us,
	--Acts 1:21
%
beginning from John’s baptism to the time when Jesus was taken up from us. 
For one of these must become a witness with us of his resurrection.”
	--Acts 1:22
%
So they nominated two men: Joseph called Barsabbas (also known as Justus) and 
Matthias.
	--Acts 1:23
%
Then they prayed, “Lord, you know everyone’s heart. Show us which of these 
two you have chosen
	--Acts 1:24
%
to take over this apostolic ministry, which Judas left to go where he 
belongs.”
	--Acts 1:25
%
Then they cast lots, and the lot fell to Matthias; so he was added to the 
eleven apostles.
	--Acts 1:26
%
When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place.
	--Acts 2:1
%
Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled 
the whole house where they were sitting.
	--Acts 2:2
%
They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on 
each of them.
	--Acts 2:3
%
All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other 
tongues as the Spirit enabled them.
	--Acts 2:4
%
Now there were staying in Jerusalem God-fearing Jews from every nation under 
heaven.
	--Acts 2:5
%
When they heard this sound, a crowd came together in bewilderment, because each 
one heard their own language being spoken.
	--Acts 2:6
%
Utterly amazed, they asked: “Aren’t all these who are speaking Galileans?
	--Acts 2:7
%
Then how is it that each of us hears them in our native language?
	--Acts 2:8
%
Parthians, Medes and Elamites; residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, 
Pontus and Asia,
	--Acts 2:9
%
Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene; visitors from 
Rome
	--Acts 2:10
%
(both Jews and converts to Judaism); Cretans and Arabs—we hear them declaring 
the wonders of God in our own tongues!”
	--Acts 2:11
%
Amazed and perplexed, they asked one another, “What does this mean?”
	--Acts 2:12
%
Some, however, made fun of them and said, “They have had too much wine.”
	--Acts 2:13
%
Then Peter stood up with the Eleven, raised his voice and addressed the crowd: 
“Fellow Jews and all of you who live in Jerusalem, let me explain this to 
you; listen carefully to what I say.
	--Acts 2:14
%
These people are not drunk, as you suppose. It’s only nine in the morning!
	--Acts 2:15
%
No, this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel:
	--Acts 2:16
%
“‘In the last days, God says, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your 
sons and daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, your old men 
will dream dreams.
	--Acts 2:17
%
Even on my servants, both men and women, I will pour out my Spirit in those 
days, and they will prophesy.
	--Acts 2:18
%
I will show wonders in the heavens above and signs on the earth below, blood 
and fire and billows of smoke.
	--Acts 2:19
%
The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of 
the great and glorious day of the Lord.
	--Acts 2:20
%
And everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.’
	--Acts 2:21
%
“Fellow Israelites, listen to this: Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by 
God to you by miracles, wonders and signs, which God did among you through him, 
as you yourselves know.
	--Acts 2:22
%
This man was handed over to you by God’s deliberate plan and foreknowledge; 
and you, with the help of wicked men, put him to death by nailing him to the 
cross.
	--Acts 2:23
%
But God raised him from the dead, freeing him from the agony of death, because 
it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him.
	--Acts 2:24
%
David said about him: “‘I saw the Lord always before me. Because he is at 
my right hand, I will not be shaken.
	--Acts 2:25
%
Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices; my body also will rest in 
hope,
	--Acts 2:26
%
because you will not abandon me to the realm of the dead, you will not let your 
holy one see decay.
	--Acts 2:27
%
You have made known to me the paths of life; you will fill me with joy in your 
presence.’
	--Acts 2:28
%
“Fellow Israelites, I can tell you confidently that the patriarch David died 
and was buried, and his tomb is here to this day.
	--Acts 2:29
%
But he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him on oath that he would 
place one of his descendants on his throne.
	--Acts 2:30
%
Seeing what was to come, he spoke of the resurrection of the Messiah, that he 
was not abandoned to the realm of the dead, nor did his body see decay.
	--Acts 2:31
%
God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of it.
	--Acts 2:32
%
Exalted to the right hand of God, he has received from the Father the promised 
Holy Spirit and has poured out what you now see and hear.
	--Acts 2:33
%
For David did not ascend to heaven, and yet he said, “‘The Lord said to my 
Lord: “Sit at my right hand
	--Acts 2:34
%
until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.”’
	--Acts 2:35
%
“Therefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom 
you crucified, both Lord and Messiah.”
	--Acts 2:36
%
When the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and 
the other apostles, “Brothers, what shall we do?”
	--Acts 2:37
%
Peter replied, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of 
Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of 
the Holy Spirit.
	--Acts 2:38
%
The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off—for all 
whom the Lord our God will call.”
	--Acts 2:39
%
With many other words he warned them; and he pleaded with them, “Save 
yourselves from this corrupt generation.”
	--Acts 2:40
%
Those who accepted his message were baptized, and about three thousand were 
added to their number that day.
	--Acts 2:41
%
They devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and to fellowship, to the 
breaking of bread and to prayer.
	--Acts 2:42
%
Everyone was filled with awe at the many wonders and signs performed by the 
apostles.
	--Acts 2:43
%
All the believers were together and had everything in common.
	--Acts 2:44
%
They sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need.
	--Acts 2:45
%
Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke 
bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts,
	--Acts 2:46
%
praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to 
their number daily those who were being saved.
	--Acts 2:47
%
One day Peter and John were going up to the temple at the time of prayer—at 
three in the afternoon.
	--Acts 3:1
%
Now a man who was lame from birth was being carried to the temple gate called 
Beautiful, where he was put every day to beg from those going into the temple 
courts.
	--Acts 3:2
%
When he saw Peter and John about to enter, he asked them for money.
	--Acts 3:3
%
Peter looked straight at him, as did John. Then Peter said, “Look at us!”
	--Acts 3:4
%
So the man gave them his attention, expecting to get something from them.
	--Acts 3:5
%
Then Peter said, “Silver or gold I do not have, but what I do have I give 
you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk.”
	--Acts 3:6
%
Taking him by the right hand, he helped him up, and instantly the man’s feet 
and ankles became strong.
	--Acts 3:7
%
He jumped to his feet and began to walk. Then he went with them into the temple 
courts, walking and jumping, and praising God.
	--Acts 3:8
%
When all the people saw him walking and praising God,
	--Acts 3:9
%
they recognized him as the same man who used to sit begging at the temple gate 
called Beautiful, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had 
happened to him.
	--Acts 3:10
%
While the man held on to Peter and John, all the people were astonished and 
came running to them in the place called Solomon’s Colonnade.

When Peter saw this, he said to them: “Fellow Israelites, why does this 
surprise you? Why do you stare at us as if by our own power or godliness we had 
made this man walk?
	--Acts 3:12
%
The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his 
servant Jesus. You handed him over to be killed, and you disowned him before 
Pilate, though he had decided to let him go.
	--Acts 3:13
%
You disowned the Holy and Righteous One and asked that a murderer be released 
to you.
	--Acts 3:14
%
You killed the author of life, but God raised him from the dead. We are 
witnesses of this.
	--Acts 3:15
%
By faith in the name of Jesus, this man whom you see and know was made strong. 
It is Jesus’ name and the faith that comes through him that has completely 
healed him, as you can all see.
	--Acts 3:16
%
“Now, fellow Israelites, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did your 
leaders.
	--Acts 3:17
%
But this is how God fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets, 
saying that his Messiah would suffer.
	--Acts 3:18
%
Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times 
of refreshing may come from the Lord,
	--Acts 3:19
%
and that he may send the Messiah, who has been appointed for you—even Jesus.
	--Acts 3:20
%
Heaven must receive him until the time comes for God to restore everything, as 
he promised long ago through his holy prophets.
	--Acts 3:21
%
For Moses said, ‘The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me 
from among your own people; you must listen to everything he tells you.
	--Acts 3:22
%
Anyone who does not listen to him will be completely cut off from their 
people.’
	--Acts 3:23
%
“Indeed, beginning with Samuel, all the prophets who have spoken have 
foretold these days.
	--Acts 3:24
%
And you are heirs of the prophets and of the covenant God made with your 
fathers. He said to Abraham, ‘Through your offspring all peoples on earth 
will be blessed.’
	--Acts 3:25
%
When God raised up his servant, he sent him first to you to bless you by 
turning each of you from your wicked ways.”
	--Acts 3:26
%
The priests and the captain of the temple guard and the Sadducees came up to 
Peter and John while they were speaking to the people.
	--Acts 4:1
%
They were greatly disturbed because the apostles were teaching the people, 
proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection of the dead.
	--Acts 4:2
%
They seized Peter and John and, because it was evening, they put them in jail 
until the next day.
	--Acts 4:3
%
But many who heard the message believed; so the number of men who believed grew 
to about five thousand.
	--Acts 4:4
%
The next day the rulers, the elders and the teachers of the law met in 
Jerusalem.
	--Acts 4:5
%
Annas the high priest was there, and so were Caiaphas, John, Alexander and 
others of the high priest’s family.
	--Acts 4:6
%
They had Peter and John brought before them and began to question them: “By 
what power or what name did you do this?”
	--Acts 4:7
%
Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them: “Rulers and elders of 
the people!
	--Acts 4:8
%
If we are being called to account today for an act of kindness shown to a man 
who was lame and are being asked how he was healed,
	--Acts 4:9
%
then know this, you and all the people of Israel: It is by the name of Jesus 
Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified but whom God raised from the dead, that 
this man stands before you healed.
	--Acts 4:10
%
Jesus is “‘the stone you builders rejected, which has become the 
cornerstone.’
	--Acts 4:11
%
Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven 
given to mankind by which we must be saved.”
	--Acts 4:12
%
When they saw the courage of Peter and John and realized that they were 
unschooled, ordinary men, they were astonished and they took note that these 
men had been with Jesus.
	--Acts 4:13
%
But since they could see the man who had been healed standing there with them, 
there was nothing they could say.
	--Acts 4:14
%
So they ordered them to withdraw from the Sanhedrin and then conferred together.
	--Acts 4:15
%
“What are we going to do with these men?” they asked. “Everyone living in 
Jerusalem knows they have performed a notable sign, and we cannot deny it.
	--Acts 4:16
%
But to stop this thing from spreading any further among the people, we must 
warn them to speak no longer to anyone in this name.”
	--Acts 4:17
%
Then they called them in again and commanded them not to speak or teach at all 
in the name of Jesus.
	--Acts 4:18
%
But Peter and John replied, “Which is right in God’s eyes: to listen to 
you, or to him? You be the judges!
	--Acts 4:19
%
As for us, we cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard.”
	--Acts 4:20
%
After further threats they let them go. They could not decide how to punish 
them, because all the people were praising God for what had happened.
	--Acts 4:21
%
For the man who was miraculously healed was over forty years old.
	--Acts 4:22
%
On their release, Peter and John went back to their own people and reported all 
that the chief priests and the elders had said to them.
	--Acts 4:23
%
When they heard this, they raised their voices together in prayer to God. 
“Sovereign Lord,” they said, “you made the heavens and the earth and the 
sea, and everything in them.
	--Acts 4:24
%
You spoke by the Holy Spirit through the mouth of your servant, our father 
David: “‘Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain?
	--Acts 4:25
%
The kings of the earth rise up and the rulers band together against the Lord 
and against his anointed one.’
	--Acts 4:26
%
Indeed Herod and Pontius Pilate met together with the Gentiles and the people 
of Israel in this city to conspire against your holy servant Jesus, whom you 
anointed.
	--Acts 4:27
%
They did what your power and will had decided beforehand should happen.
	--Acts 4:28
%
Now, Lord, consider their threats and enable your servants to speak your word 
with great boldness.
	--Acts 4:29
%
Stretch out your hand to heal and perform signs and wonders through the name of 
your holy servant Jesus.”
	--Acts 4:30
%
After they prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken. And they were 
all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God boldly.
	--Acts 4:31
%
All the believers were one in heart and mind. No one claimed that any of their 
possessions was their own, but they shared everything they had.
	--Acts 4:32
%
With great power the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the 
Lord Jesus. And God’s grace was so powerfully at work in them all
	--Acts 4:33
%
that there were no needy persons among them. For from time to time those who 
owned land or houses sold them, brought the money from the sales
	--Acts 4:34
%
and put it at the apostles’ feet, and it was distributed to anyone who had 
need.
	--Acts 4:35
%
Joseph, a Levite from Cyprus, whom the apostles called Barnabas (which means 
“son of encouragement”),
	--Acts 4:36
%
sold a field he owned and brought the money and put it at the apostles’ feet.
	--Acts 4:37
%
Now a man named Ananias, together with his wife Sapphira, also sold a piece of 
property.
	--Acts 5:1
%
With his wife’s full knowledge he kept back part of the money for himself, 
but brought the rest and put it at the apostles’ feet.
	--Acts 5:2
%
Then Peter said, “Ananias, how is it that Satan has so filled your heart that 
you have lied to the Holy Spirit and have kept for yourself some of the money 
you received for the land?
	--Acts 5:3
%
Didn’t it belong to you before it was sold? And after it was sold, wasn’t 
the money at your disposal? What made you think of doing such a thing? You have 
not lied just to human beings but to God.”
	--Acts 5:4
%
When Ananias heard this, he fell down and died. And great fear seized all who 
heard what had happened.
	--Acts 5:5
%
Then some young men came forward, wrapped up his body, and carried him out and 
buried him.
	--Acts 5:6
%
About three hours later his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.
	--Acts 5:7
%
Peter asked her, “Tell me, is this the price you and Ananias got for the 
land?” “Yes,” she said, “that is the price.”
	--Acts 5:8
%
Peter said to her, “How could you conspire to test the Spirit of the Lord? 
Listen! The feet of the men who buried your husband are at the door, and they 
will carry you out also.”
	--Acts 5:9
%
At that moment she fell down at his feet and died. Then the young men came in 
and, finding her dead, carried her out and buried her beside her husband.
	--Acts 5:10
%
Great fear seized the whole church and all who heard about these events.
	--Acts 5:11
%
The apostles performed many signs and wonders among the people. And all the 
believers used to meet together in Solomon’s Colonnade.
	--Acts 5:12
%
No one else dared join them, even though they were highly regarded by the 
people.
	--Acts 5:13
%
Nevertheless, more and more men and women believed in the Lord and were added 
to their number.
	--Acts 5:14
%
As a result, people brought the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and 
mats so that at least Peter’s shadow might fall on some of them as he passed 
by.
	--Acts 5:15
%
Crowds gathered also from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing their sick and 
those tormented by impure spirits, and all of them were healed.
	--Acts 5:16
%
Then the high priest and all his associates, who were members of the party of 
the Sadducees, were filled with jealousy.
	--Acts 5:17
%
They arrested the apostles and put them in the public jail.
	--Acts 5:18
%
But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the jail and 
brought them out.
	--Acts 5:19
%
“Go, stand in the temple courts,” he said, “and tell the people all about 
this new life.”
	--Acts 5:20
%
At daybreak they entered the temple courts, as they had been told, and began to 
teach the people. When the high priest and his associates arrived, they called 
together the Sanhedrin—the full assembly of the elders of Israel—and sent 
to the jail for the apostles.
	--Acts 5:21
%
But on arriving at the jail, the officers did not find them there. So they went 
back and reported,
	--Acts 5:22
%
“We found the jail securely locked, with the guards standing at the doors; 
but when we opened them, we found no one inside.”
	--Acts 5:23
%
On hearing this report, the captain of the temple guard and the chief priests 
were at a loss, wondering what this might lead to.
	--Acts 5:24
%
Then someone came and said, “Look! The men you put in jail are standing in 
the temple courts teaching the people.”
	--Acts 5:25
%
At that, the captain went with his officers and brought the apostles. They did 
not use force, because they feared that the people would stone them.
	--Acts 5:26
%
The apostles were brought in and made to appear before the Sanhedrin to be 
questioned by the high priest.
	--Acts 5:27
%
“We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name,” he said. “Yet you 
have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are determined to make us guilty 
of this man’s blood.”
	--Acts 5:28
%
Peter and the other apostles replied: “We must obey God rather than human 
beings!
	--Acts 5:29
%
The God of our ancestors raised Jesus from the dead—whom you killed by 
hanging him on a cross.
	--Acts 5:30
%
God exalted him to his own right hand as Prince and Savior that he might bring 
Israel to repentance and forgive their sins.
	--Acts 5:31
%
We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given 
to those who obey him.”
	--Acts 5:32
%
When they heard this, they were furious and wanted to put them to death.
	--Acts 5:33
%
But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, who was honored by all the 
people, stood up in the Sanhedrin and ordered that the men be put outside for a 
little while.
	--Acts 5:34
%
Then he addressed the Sanhedrin: “Men of Israel, consider carefully what you 
intend to do to these men.
	--Acts 5:35
%
Some time ago Theudas appeared, claiming to be somebody, and about four hundred 
men rallied to him. He was killed, all his followers were dispersed, and it all 
came to nothing.
	--Acts 5:36
%
After him, Judas the Galilean appeared in the days of the census and led a band 
of people in revolt. He too was killed, and all his followers were scattered.
	--Acts 5:37
%
Therefore, in the present case I advise you: Leave these men alone! Let them 
go! For if their purpose or activity is of human origin, it will fail.
	--Acts 5:38
%
But if it is from God, you will not be able to stop these men; you will only 
find yourselves fighting against God.”
	--Acts 5:39
%
His speech persuaded them. They called the apostles in and had them flogged. 
Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.
	--Acts 5:40
%
The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been counted worthy 
of suffering disgrace for the Name.
	--Acts 5:41
%
Day after day, in the temple courts and from house to house, they never stopped 
teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus is the Messiah.
	--Acts 5:42
%
In those days when the number of disciples was increasing, the Hellenistic Jews 
among them complained against the Hebraic Jews because their widows were being 
overlooked in the daily distribution of food.
	--Acts 6:1
%
So the Twelve gathered all the disciples together and said, “It would not be 
right for us to neglect the ministry of the word of God in order to wait on 
tables.
	--Acts 6:2
%
Brothers and sisters, choose seven men from among you who are known to be full 
of the Spirit and wisdom. We will turn this responsibility over to them
	--Acts 6:3
%
and will give our attention to prayer and the ministry of the word.”
	--Acts 6:4
%
This proposal pleased the whole group. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith 
and of the Holy Spirit; also Philip, Procorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and 
Nicolas from Antioch, a convert to Judaism.
	--Acts 6:5
%
They presented these men to the apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on 
them.
	--Acts 6:6
%
So the word of God spread. The number of disciples in Jerusalem increased 
rapidly, and a large number of priests became obedient to the faith.
	--Acts 6:7
%
Now Stephen, a man full of God’s grace and power, performed great wonders and 
signs among the people.
	--Acts 6:8
%
Opposition arose, however, from members of the Synagogue of the Freedmen (as it 
was called)—Jews of Cyrene and Alexandria as well as the provinces of Cilicia 
and Asia—who began to argue with Stephen.
	--Acts 6:9
%
But they could not stand up against the wisdom the Spirit gave him as he spoke.
	--Acts 6:10
%
Then they secretly persuaded some men to say, “We have heard Stephen speak 
blasphemous words against Moses and against God.”
	--Acts 6:11
%
So they stirred up the people and the elders and the teachers of the law. They 
seized Stephen and brought him before the Sanhedrin.
	--Acts 6:12
%
They produced false witnesses, who testified, “This fellow never stops 
speaking against this holy place and against the law.
	--Acts 6:13
%
For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place 
and change the customs Moses handed down to us.”
	--Acts 6:14
%
All who were sitting in the Sanhedrin looked intently at Stephen, and they saw 
that his face was like the face of an angel.
	--Acts 6:15
%
Then the high priest asked Stephen, “Are these charges true?”
	--Acts 7:1
%
To this he replied: “Brothers and fathers, listen to me! The God of glory 
appeared to our father Abraham while he was still in Mesopotamia, before he 
lived in Harran.
	--Acts 7:2
%
‘Leave your country and your people,’ God said, ‘and go to the land I 
will show you.’
	--Acts 7:3
%
“So he left the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Harran. After the death 
of his father, God sent him to this land where you are now living.
	--Acts 7:4
%
He gave him no inheritance here, not even enough ground to set his foot on. But 
God promised him that he and his descendants after him would possess the land, 
even though at that time Abraham had no child.
	--Acts 7:5
%
God spoke to him in this way: ‘For four hundred years your descendants will 
be strangers in a country not their own, and they will be enslaved and 
mistreated.
	--Acts 7:6
%
But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves,’ God said, ‘and 
afterward they will come out of that country and worship me in this place.’
	--Acts 7:7
%
Then he gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision. And Abraham became the 
father of Isaac and circumcised him eight days after his birth. Later Isaac 
became the father of Jacob, and Jacob became the father of the twelve 
patriarchs.
	--Acts 7:8
%
“Because the patriarchs were jealous of Joseph, they sold him as a slave into 
Egypt. But God was with him
	--Acts 7:9
%
and rescued him from all his troubles. He gave Joseph wisdom and enabled him to 
gain the goodwill of Pharaoh king of Egypt. So Pharaoh made him ruler over 
Egypt and all his palace.
	--Acts 7:10
%
“Then a famine struck all Egypt and Canaan, bringing great suffering, and our 
ancestors could not find food.
	--Acts 7:11
%
When Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our forefathers on 
their first visit.
	--Acts 7:12
%
On their second visit, Joseph told his brothers who he was, and Pharaoh learned 
about Joseph’s family.
	--Acts 7:13
%
After this, Joseph sent for his father Jacob and his whole family, seventy-five 
in all.
	--Acts 7:14
%
Then Jacob went down to Egypt, where he and our ancestors died.
	--Acts 7:15
%
Their bodies were brought back to Shechem and placed in the tomb that Abraham 
had bought from the sons of Hamor at Shechem for a certain sum of money.
	--Acts 7:16
%
“As the time drew near for God to fulfill his promise to Abraham, the number 
of our people in Egypt had greatly increased.
	--Acts 7:17
%
Then ‘a new king, to whom Joseph meant nothing, came to power in Egypt.’
	--Acts 7:18
%
He dealt treacherously with our people and oppressed our ancestors by forcing 
them to throw out their newborn babies so that they would die.
	--Acts 7:19
%
“At that time Moses was born, and he was no ordinary child. For three months 
he was cared for by his family.
	--Acts 7:20
%
When he was placed outside, Pharaoh’s daughter took him and brought him up as 
her own son.
	--Acts 7:21
%
Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was powerful in 
speech and action.
	--Acts 7:22
%
“When Moses was forty years old, he decided to visit his own people, the 
Israelites.
	--Acts 7:23
%
He saw one of them being mistreated by an Egyptian, so he went to his defense 
and avenged him by killing the Egyptian.
	--Acts 7:24
%
Moses thought that his own people would realize that God was using him to 
rescue them, but they did not.
	--Acts 7:25
%
The next day Moses came upon two Israelites who were fighting. He tried to 
reconcile them by saying, ‘Men, you are brothers; why do you want to hurt 
each other?’
	--Acts 7:26
%
“But the man who was mistreating the other pushed Moses aside and said, 
‘Who made you ruler and judge over us?
	--Acts 7:27
%
Are you thinking of killing me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?’
	--Acts 7:28
%
When Moses heard this, he fled to Midian, where he settled as a foreigner and 
had two sons.
	--Acts 7:29
%
“After forty years had passed, an angel appeared to Moses in the flames of a 
burning bush in the desert near Mount Sinai.
	--Acts 7:30
%
When he saw this, he was amazed at the sight. As he went over to get a closer 
look, he heard the Lord say:
	--Acts 7:31
%
‘I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.’ Moses 
trembled with fear and did not dare to look.
	--Acts 7:32
%
“Then the Lord said to him, ‘Take off your sandals, for the place where you 
are standing is holy ground.
	--Acts 7:33
%
I have indeed seen the oppression of my people in Egypt. I have heard their 
groaning and have come down to set them free. Now come, I will send you back to 
Egypt.’
	--Acts 7:34
%
“This is the same Moses they had rejected with the words, ‘Who made you 
ruler and judge?’ He was sent to be their ruler and deliverer by God himself, 
through the angel who appeared to him in the bush.
	--Acts 7:35
%
He led them out of Egypt and performed wonders and signs in Egypt, at the Red 
Sea and for forty years in the wilderness.
	--Acts 7:36
%
“This is the Moses who told the Israelites, ‘God will raise up for you a 
prophet like me from your own people.’
	--Acts 7:37
%
He was in the assembly in the wilderness, with the angel who spoke to him on 
Mount Sinai, and with our ancestors; and he received living words to pass on to 
us.
	--Acts 7:38
%
“But our ancestors refused to obey him. Instead, they rejected him and in 
their hearts turned back to Egypt.
	--Acts 7:39
%
They told Aaron, ‘Make us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow 
Moses who led us out of Egypt—we don’t know what has happened to him!’
	--Acts 7:40
%
That was the time they made an idol in the form of a calf. They brought 
sacrifices to it and reveled in what their own hands had made.
	--Acts 7:41
%
But God turned away from them and gave them over to the worship of the sun, 
moon and stars. This agrees with what is written in the book of the prophets: 
“‘Did you bring me sacrifices and offerings forty years in the wilderness, 
people of Israel?
	--Acts 7:42
%
You have taken up the tabernacle of Molek and the star of your god Rephan, the 
idols you made to worship. Therefore I will send you into exile’ beyond 
Babylon.
	--Acts 7:43
%
“Our ancestors had the tabernacle of the covenant law with them in the 
wilderness. It had been made as God directed Moses, according to the pattern he 
had seen.
	--Acts 7:44
%
After receiving the tabernacle, our ancestors under Joshua brought it with them 
when they took the land from the nations God drove out before them. It remained 
in the land until the time of David,
	--Acts 7:45
%
who enjoyed God’s favor and asked that he might provide a dwelling place for 
the God of Jacob.
	--Acts 7:46
%
But it was Solomon who built a house for him.
	--Acts 7:47
%
“However, the Most High does not live in houses made by human hands. As the 
prophet says:
	--Acts 7:48
%
“‘Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. What kind of house 
will you build for me? says the Lord. Or where will my resting place be?
	--Acts 7:49
%
Has not my hand made all these things?’
	--Acts 7:50
%
“You stiff-necked people! Your hearts and ears are still uncircumcised. You 
are just like your ancestors: You always resist the Holy Spirit!
	--Acts 7:51
%
Was there ever a prophet your ancestors did not persecute? They even killed 
those who predicted the coming of the Righteous One. And now you have betrayed 
and murdered him—
	--Acts 7:52
%
you who have received the law that was given through angels but have not obeyed 
it.”
	--Acts 7:53
%
When the members of the Sanhedrin heard this, they were furious and gnashed 
their teeth at him.
	--Acts 7:54
%
But Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, looked up to heaven and saw the glory of 
God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.
	--Acts 7:55
%
“Look,” he said, “I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at the 
right hand of God.”
	--Acts 7:56
%
At this they covered their ears and, yelling at the top of their voices, they 
all rushed at him,
	--Acts 7:57
%
dragged him out of the city and began to stone him. Meanwhile, the witnesses 
laid their coats at the feet of a young man named Saul.
	--Acts 7:58
%
While they were stoning him, Stephen prayed, “Lord Jesus, receive my 
spirit.”
	--Acts 7:59
%
Then he fell on his knees and cried out, “Lord, do not hold this sin against 
them.” When he had said this, he fell asleep.
	--Acts 7:60
%
And Saul approved of their killing him. On that day a great persecution broke 
out against the church in Jerusalem, and all except the apostles were scattered 
throughout Judea and Samaria.
	--Acts 8:1
%
Godly men buried Stephen and mourned deeply for him.
	--Acts 8:2
%
But Saul began to destroy the church. Going from house to house, he dragged off 
both men and women and put them in prison.
	--Acts 8:3
%
Those who had been scattered preached the word wherever they went.
	--Acts 8:4
%
Philip went down to a city in Samaria and proclaimed the Messiah there.
	--Acts 8:5
%
When the crowds heard Philip and saw the signs he performed, they all paid 
close attention to what he said.
	--Acts 8:6
%
For with shrieks, impure spirits came out of many, and many who were paralyzed 
or lame were healed.
	--Acts 8:7
%
So there was great joy in that city.
	--Acts 8:8
%
Now for some time a man named Simon had practiced sorcery in the city and 
amazed all the people of Samaria. He boasted that he was someone great,
	--Acts 8:9
%
and all the people, both high and low, gave him their attention and exclaimed, 
“This man is rightly called the Great Power of God.”
	--Acts 8:10
%
They followed him because he had amazed them for a long time with his sorcery.
	--Acts 8:11
%
But when they believed Philip as he proclaimed the good news of the kingdom of 
God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.
	--Acts 8:12
%
Simon himself believed and was baptized. And he followed Philip everywhere, 
astonished by the great signs and miracles he saw.
	--Acts 8:13
%
When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, 
they sent Peter and John to Samaria.
	--Acts 8:14
%
When they arrived, they prayed for the new believers there that they might 
receive the Holy Spirit,
	--Acts 8:15
%
because the Holy Spirit had not yet come on any of them; they had simply been 
baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
	--Acts 8:16
%
Then Peter and John placed their hands on them, and they received the Holy 
Spirit.
	--Acts 8:17
%
When Simon saw that the Spirit was given at the laying on of the apostles’ 
hands, he offered them money
	--Acts 8:18
%
and said, “Give me also this ability so that everyone on whom I lay my hands 
may receive the Holy Spirit.”
	--Acts 8:19
%
Peter answered: “May your money perish with you, because you thought you 
could buy the gift of God with money!
	--Acts 8:20
%
You have no part or share in this ministry, because your heart is not right 
before God.
	--Acts 8:21
%
Repent of this wickedness and pray to the Lord in the hope that he may forgive 
you for having such a thought in your heart.
	--Acts 8:22
%
For I see that you are full of bitterness and captive to sin.”
	--Acts 8:23
%
Then Simon answered, “Pray to the Lord for me so that nothing you have said 
may happen to me.”
	--Acts 8:24
%
After they had further proclaimed the word of the Lord and testified about 
Jesus, Peter and John returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel in many 
Samaritan villages.
	--Acts 8:25
%
Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, “Go south to the road—the desert 
road—that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.”
	--Acts 8:26
%
So he started out, and on his way he met an Ethiopian eunuch, an important 
official in charge of all the treasury of the Kandake (which means “queen of 
the Ethiopians”). This man had gone to Jerusalem to worship,
	--Acts 8:27
%
and on his way home was sitting in his chariot reading the Book of Isaiah the 
prophet.
	--Acts 8:28
%
The Spirit told Philip, “Go to that chariot and stay near it.”
	--Acts 8:29
%
Then Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet. 
“Do you understand what you are reading?” Philip asked.
	--Acts 8:30
%
“How can I,” he said, “unless someone explains it to me?” So he invited 
Philip to come up and sit with him.
	--Acts 8:31
%
This is the passage of Scripture the eunuch was reading: “He was led like a 
sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before its shearer is silent, so he did 
not open his mouth.
	--Acts 8:32
%
In his humiliation he was deprived of justice. Who can speak of his 
descendants? For his life was taken from the earth.”
	--Acts 8:33
%
The eunuch asked Philip, “Tell me, please, who is the prophet talking about, 
himself or someone else?”
	--Acts 8:34
%
Then Philip began with that very passage of Scripture and told him the good 
news about Jesus.
	--Acts 8:35
%
As they traveled along the road, they came to some water and the eunuch said, 
“Look, here is water. What can stand in the way of my being baptized?”
	--Acts 8:36
%

	--Acts 8:37
%
And he gave orders to stop the chariot. Then both Philip and the eunuch went 
down into the water and Philip baptized him.
	--Acts 8:38
%
When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord suddenly took Philip 
away, and the eunuch did not see him again, but went on his way rejoicing.
	--Acts 8:39
%
Philip, however, appeared at Azotus and traveled about, preaching the gospel in 
all the towns until he reached Caesarea.
	--Acts 8:40
%
Meanwhile, Saul was still breathing out murderous threats against the Lord’s 
disciples. He went to the high priest
	--Acts 9:1
%
and asked him for letters to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found 
any there who belonged to the Way, whether men or women, he might take them as 
prisoners to Jerusalem.
	--Acts 9:2
%
As he neared Damascus on his journey, suddenly a light from heaven flashed 
around him.
	--Acts 9:3
%
He fell to the ground and heard a voice say to him, “Saul, Saul, why do you 
persecute me?”
	--Acts 9:4
%
“Who are you, Lord?” Saul asked. “I am Jesus, whom you are 
persecuting,” he replied.
	--Acts 9:5
%
“Now get up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do.”
	--Acts 9:6
%
The men traveling with Saul stood there speechless; they heard the sound but 
did not see anyone.
	--Acts 9:7
%
Saul got up from the ground, but when he opened his eyes he could see nothing. 
So they led him by the hand into Damascus.
	--Acts 9:8
%
For three days he was blind, and did not eat or drink anything.
	--Acts 9:9
%
In Damascus there was a disciple named Ananias. The Lord called to him in a 
vision, “Ananias!” “Yes, Lord,” he answered.
	--Acts 9:10
%
The Lord told him, “Go to the house of Judas on Straight Street and ask for a 
man from Tarsus named Saul, for he is praying.
	--Acts 9:11
%
In a vision he has seen a man named Ananias come and place his hands on him to 
restore his sight.”
	--Acts 9:12
%
“Lord,” Ananias answered, “I have heard many reports about this man and 
all the harm he has done to your holy people in Jerusalem.
	--Acts 9:13
%
And he has come here with authority from the chief priests to arrest all who 
call on your name.”
	--Acts 9:14
%
But the Lord said to Ananias, “Go! This man is my chosen instrument to 
proclaim my name to the Gentiles and their kings and to the people of Israel.
	--Acts 9:15
%
I will show him how much he must suffer for my name.”
	--Acts 9:16
%
Then Ananias went to the house and entered it. Placing his hands on Saul, he 
said, “Brother Saul, the Lord—Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you 
were coming here—has sent me so that you may see again and be filled with the 
Holy Spirit.”
	--Acts 9:17
%
Immediately, something like scales fell from Saul’s eyes, and he could see 
again. He got up and was baptized,
	--Acts 9:18
%
and after taking some food, he regained his strength. Saul spent several days 
with the disciples in Damascus.
	--Acts 9:19
%
At once he began to preach in the synagogues that Jesus is the Son of God.
	--Acts 9:20
%
All those who heard him were astonished and asked, “Isn’t he the man who 
raised havoc in Jerusalem among those who call on this name? And hasn’t he 
come here to take them as prisoners to the chief priests?”
	--Acts 9:21
%
Yet Saul grew more and more powerful and baffled the Jews living in Damascus by 
proving that Jesus is the Messiah.
	--Acts 9:22
%
After many days had gone by, there was a conspiracy among the Jews to kill him,
	--Acts 9:23
%
but Saul learned of their plan. Day and night they kept close watch on the city 
gates in order to kill him.
	--Acts 9:24
%
But his followers took him by night and lowered him in a basket through an 
opening in the wall.
	--Acts 9:25
%
When he came to Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples, but they were all 
afraid of him, not believing that he really was a disciple.
	--Acts 9:26
%
But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles. He told them how Saul on 
his journey had seen the Lord and that the Lord had spoken to him, and how in 
Damascus he had preached fearlessly in the name of Jesus.
	--Acts 9:27
%
So Saul stayed with them and moved about freely in Jerusalem, speaking boldly 
in the name of the Lord.
	--Acts 9:28
%
He talked and debated with the Hellenistic Jews, but they tried to kill him.
	--Acts 9:29
%
When the believers learned of this, they took him down to Caesarea and sent him 
off to Tarsus.
	--Acts 9:30
%
Then the church throughout Judea, Galilee and Samaria enjoyed a time of peace 
and was strengthened. Living in the fear of the Lord and encouraged by the Holy 
Spirit, it increased in numbers.
	--Acts 9:31
%
As Peter traveled about the country, he went to visit the Lord’s people who 
lived in Lydda.
	--Acts 9:32
%
There he found a man named Aeneas, who was paralyzed and had been bedridden for 
eight years.
	--Acts 9:33
%
“Aeneas,” Peter said to him, “Jesus Christ heals you. Get up and roll up 
your mat.” Immediately Aeneas got up.
	--Acts 9:34
%
All those who lived in Lydda and Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord.
	--Acts 9:35
%
In Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha (in Greek her name is Dorcas); she 
was always doing good and helping the poor.
	--Acts 9:36
%
About that time she became sick and died, and her body was washed and placed in 
an upstairs room.
	--Acts 9:37
%
Lydda was near Joppa; so when the disciples heard that Peter was in Lydda, they 
sent two men to him and urged him, “Please come at once!”
	--Acts 9:38
%
Peter went with them, and when he arrived he was taken upstairs to the room. 
All the widows stood around him, crying and showing him the robes and other 
clothing that Dorcas had made while she was still with them.
	--Acts 9:39
%
Peter sent them all out of the room; then he got down on his knees and prayed. 
Turning toward the dead woman, he said, “Tabitha, get up.” She opened her 
eyes, and seeing Peter she sat up.
	--Acts 9:40
%
He took her by the hand and helped her to her feet. Then he called for the 
believers, especially the widows, and presented her to them alive.
	--Acts 9:41
%
This became known all over Joppa, and many people believed in the Lord.
	--Acts 9:42
%
Peter stayed in Joppa for some time with a tanner named Simon.
	--Acts 9:43
%
At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion in what was known as 
the Italian Regiment.
	--Acts 10:1
%
He and all his family were devout and God-fearing; he gave generously to those 
in need and prayed to God regularly.
	--Acts 10:2
%
One day at about three in the afternoon he had a vision. He distinctly saw an 
angel of God, who came to him and said, “Cornelius!”
	--Acts 10:3
%
Cornelius stared at him in fear. “What is it, Lord?” he asked. The angel 
answered, “Your prayers and gifts to the poor have come up as a memorial 
offering before God.
	--Acts 10:4
%
Now send men to Joppa to bring back a man named Simon who is called Peter.
	--Acts 10:5
%
He is staying with Simon the tanner, whose house is by the sea.”
	--Acts 10:6
%
When the angel who spoke to him had gone, Cornelius called two of his servants 
and a devout soldier who was one of his attendants.
	--Acts 10:7
%
He told them everything that had happened and sent them to Joppa.
	--Acts 10:8
%
About noon the following day as they were on their journey and approaching the 
city, Peter went up on the roof to pray.
	--Acts 10:9
%
He became hungry and wanted something to eat, and while the meal was being 
prepared, he fell into a trance.
	--Acts 10:10
%
He saw heaven opened and something like a large sheet being let down to earth 
by its four corners.
	--Acts 10:11
%
It contained all kinds of four-footed animals, as well as reptiles and birds.
	--Acts 10:12
%
Then a voice told him, “Get up, Peter. Kill and eat.”
	--Acts 10:13
%
“Surely not, Lord!” Peter replied. “I have never eaten anything impure or 
unclean.”
	--Acts 10:14
%
The voice spoke to him a second time, “Do not call anything impure that God 
has made clean.”
	--Acts 10:15
%
This happened three times, and immediately the sheet was taken back to heaven.
	--Acts 10:16
%
While Peter was wondering about the meaning of the vision, the men sent by 
Cornelius found out where Simon’s house was and stopped at the gate.
	--Acts 10:17
%
They called out, asking if Simon who was known as Peter was staying there.
	--Acts 10:18
%
While Peter was still thinking about the vision, the Spirit said to him, 
“Simon, three men are looking for you.
	--Acts 10:19
%
So get up and go downstairs. Do not hesitate to go with them, for I have sent 
them.”
	--Acts 10:20
%
Peter went down and said to the men, “I’m the one you’re looking for. Why 
have you come?”
	--Acts 10:21
%
The men replied, “We have come from Cornelius the centurion. He is a 
righteous and God-fearing man, who is respected by all the Jewish people. A 
holy angel told him to ask you to come to his house so that he could hear what 
you have to say.”
	--Acts 10:22
%
Then Peter invited the men into the house to be his guests. The next day Peter 
started out with them, and some of the believers from Joppa went along.
	--Acts 10:23
%
The following day he arrived in Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had 
called together his relatives and close friends.
	--Acts 10:24
%
As Peter entered the house, Cornelius met him and fell at his feet in reverence.
	--Acts 10:25
%
But Peter made him get up. “Stand up,” he said, “I am only a man 
myself.”
	--Acts 10:26
%
While talking with him, Peter went inside and found a large gathering of people.
	--Acts 10:27
%
He said to them: “You are well aware that it is against our law for a Jew to 
associate with or visit a Gentile. But God has shown me that I should not call 
anyone impure or unclean.
	--Acts 10:28
%
So when I was sent for, I came without raising any objection. May I ask why you 
sent for me?”
	--Acts 10:29
%
Cornelius answered: “Three days ago I was in my house praying at this hour, 
at three in the afternoon. Suddenly a man in shining clothes stood before me
	--Acts 10:30
%
and said, ‘Cornelius, God has heard your prayer and remembered your gifts to 
the poor.
	--Acts 10:31
%
Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter. He is a guest in the home of Simon 
the tanner, who lives by the sea.’
	--Acts 10:32
%
So I sent for you immediately, and it was good of you to come. Now we are all 
here in the presence of God to listen to everything the Lord has commanded you 
to tell us.”
	--Acts 10:33
%
Then Peter began to speak: “I now realize how true it is that God does not 
show favoritism
	--Acts 10:34
%
but accepts from every nation the one who fears him and does what is right.
	--Acts 10:35
%
You know the message God sent to the people of Israel, announcing the good news 
of peace through Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all.
	--Acts 10:36
%
You know what has happened throughout the province of Judea, beginning in 
Galilee after the baptism that John preached—
	--Acts 10:37
%
how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, and how he 
went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil, 
because God was with him.
	--Acts 10:38
%
“We are witnesses of everything he did in the country of the Jews and in 
Jerusalem. They killed him by hanging him on a cross,
	--Acts 10:39
%
but God raised him from the dead on the third day and caused him to be seen.
	--Acts 10:40
%
He was not seen by all the people, but by witnesses whom God had already 
chosen—by us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.
	--Acts 10:41
%
He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one whom 
God appointed as judge of the living and the dead.
	--Acts 10:42
%
All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives 
forgiveness of sins through his name.”
	--Acts 10:43
%
While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came on all who 
heard the message.
	--Acts 10:44
%
The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astonished that the gift 
of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on Gentiles.
	--Acts 10:45
%
For they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God. Then Peter said,
	--Acts 10:46
%
“Surely no one can stand in the way of their being baptized with water. They 
have received the Holy Spirit just as we have.”
	--Acts 10:47
%
So he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they 
asked Peter to stay with them for a few days.
	--Acts 10:48
%
The apostles and the believers throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also 
had received the word of God.
	--Acts 11:1
%
So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcised believers criticized him
	--Acts 11:2
%
and said, “You went into the house of uncircumcised men and ate with them.”
	--Acts 11:3
%
Starting from the beginning, Peter told them the whole story:
	--Acts 11:4
%
“I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision. I saw 
something like a large sheet being let down from heaven by its four corners, 
and it came down to where I was.
	--Acts 11:5
%
I looked into it and saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, 
reptiles and birds.
	--Acts 11:6
%
Then I heard a voice telling me, ‘Get up, Peter. Kill and eat.’
	--Acts 11:7
%
“I replied, ‘Surely not, Lord! Nothing impure or unclean has ever entered 
my mouth.’
	--Acts 11:8
%
“The voice spoke from heaven a second time, ‘Do not call anything impure 
that God has made clean.’
	--Acts 11:9
%
This happened three times, and then it was all pulled up to heaven again.
	--Acts 11:10
%
“Right then three men who had been sent to me from Caesarea stopped at the 
house where I was staying.
	--Acts 11:11
%
The Spirit told me to have no hesitation about going with them. These six 
brothers also went with me, and we entered the man’s house.
	--Acts 11:12
%
He told us how he had seen an angel appear in his house and say, ‘Send to 
Joppa for Simon who is called Peter.
	--Acts 11:13
%
He will bring you a message through which you and all your household will be 
saved.’
	--Acts 11:14
%
“As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit came on them as he had come on us at 
the beginning.
	--Acts 11:15
%
Then I remembered what the Lord had said: ‘John baptized with water, but you 
will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.’
	--Acts 11:16
%
So if God gave them the same gift he gave us who believed in the Lord Jesus 
Christ, who was I to think that I could stand in God’s way?”
	--Acts 11:17
%
When they heard this, they had no further objections and praised God, saying, 
“So then, even to Gentiles God has granted repentance that leads to life.”
	--Acts 11:18
%
Now those who had been scattered by the persecution that broke out when Stephen 
was killed traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus and Antioch, spreading the word 
only among Jews.
	--Acts 11:19
%
Some of them, however, men from Cyprus and Cyrene, went to Antioch and began to 
speak to Greeks also, telling them the good news about the Lord Jesus.
	--Acts 11:20
%
The Lord’s hand was with them, and a great number of people believed and 
turned to the Lord.
	--Acts 11:21
%
News of this reached the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.
	--Acts 11:22
%
When he arrived and saw what the grace of God had done, he was glad and 
encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with all their hearts.
	--Acts 11:23
%
He was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith, and a great number of 
people were brought to the Lord.
	--Acts 11:24
%
Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul,
	--Acts 11:25
%
and when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. So for a whole year Barnabas 
and Saul met with the church and taught great numbers of people. The disciples 
were called Christians first at Antioch.
	--Acts 11:26
%
During this time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.
	--Acts 11:27
%
One of them, named Agabus, stood up and through the Spirit predicted that a 
severe famine would spread over the entire Roman world. (This happened during 
the reign of Claudius.)
	--Acts 11:28
%
The disciples, as each one was able, decided to provide help for the brothers 
and sisters living in Judea.
	--Acts 11:29
%
This they did, sending their gift to the elders by Barnabas and Saul.
	--Acts 11:30
%
It was about this time that King Herod arrested some who belonged to the 
church, intending to persecute them.
	--Acts 12:1
%
He had James, the brother of John, put to death with the sword.
	--Acts 12:2
%
When he saw that this met with approval among the Jews, he proceeded to seize 
Peter also. This happened during the Festival of Unleavened Bread.
	--Acts 12:3
%
After arresting him, he put him in prison, handing him over to be guarded by 
four squads of four soldiers each. Herod intended to bring him out for public 
trial after the Passover.
	--Acts 12:4
%
So Peter was kept in prison, but the church was earnestly praying to God for 
him.
	--Acts 12:5
%
The night before Herod was to bring him to trial, Peter was sleeping between 
two soldiers, bound with two chains, and sentries stood guard at the entrance.
	--Acts 12:6
%
Suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared and a light shone in the cell. He struck 
Peter on the side and woke him up. “Quick, get up!” he said, and the chains 
fell off Peter’s wrists.
	--Acts 12:7
%
Then the angel said to him, “Put on your clothes and sandals.” And Peter 
did so. “Wrap your cloak around you and follow me,” the angel told him.
	--Acts 12:8
%
Peter followed him out of the prison, but he had no idea that what the angel 
was doing was really happening; he thought he was seeing a vision.
	--Acts 12:9
%
They passed the first and second guards and came to the iron gate leading to 
the city. It opened for them by itself, and they went through it. When they had 
walked the length of one street, suddenly the angel left him.
	--Acts 12:10
%
Then Peter came to himself and said, “Now I know without a doubt that the 
Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from Herod’s clutches and from 
everything the Jewish people were hoping would happen.”
	--Acts 12:11
%
When this had dawned on him, he went to the house of Mary the mother of John, 
also called Mark, where many people had gathered and were praying.
	--Acts 12:12
%
Peter knocked at the outer entrance, and a servant named Rhoda came to answer 
the door.
	--Acts 12:13
%
When she recognized Peter’s voice, she was so overjoyed she ran back without 
opening it and exclaimed, “Peter is at the door!”
	--Acts 12:14
%
“You’re out of your mind,” they told her. When she kept insisting that it 
was so, they said, “It must be his angel.”
	--Acts 12:15
%
But Peter kept on knocking, and when they opened the door and saw him, they 
were astonished.
	--Acts 12:16
%
Peter motioned with his hand for them to be quiet and described how the Lord 
had brought him out of prison. “Tell James and the other brothers and sisters 
about this,” he said, and then he left for another place.
	--Acts 12:17
%
In the morning, there was no small commotion among the soldiers as to what had 
become of Peter.
	--Acts 12:18
%
After Herod had a thorough search made for him and did not find him, he 
cross-examined the guards and ordered that they be executed. Then Herod went 
from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there.
	--Acts 12:19
%
He had been quarreling with the people of Tyre and Sidon; they now joined 
together and sought an audience with him. After securing the support of 
Blastus, a trusted personal servant of the king, they asked for peace, because 
they depended on the king’s country for their food supply.
	--Acts 12:20
%
On the appointed day Herod, wearing his royal robes, sat on his throne and 
delivered a public address to the people.
	--Acts 12:21
%
They shouted, “This is the voice of a god, not of a man.”
	--Acts 12:22
%
Immediately, because Herod did not give praise to God, an angel of the Lord 
struck him down, and he was eaten by worms and died.
	--Acts 12:23
%
But the word of God continued to spread and flourish.
	--Acts 12:24
%
When Barnabas and Saul had finished their mission, they returned from 
Jerusalem, taking with them John, also called Mark.
	--Acts 12:25
%
13 Now in the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers: Barnabas, 
Simeon called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen (who had been brought up with 
Herod the tetrarch) and Saul.
	--Acts 13:1
%
While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, “Set 
apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.”
	--Acts 13:2
%
So after they had fasted and prayed, they placed their hands on them and sent 
them off.
	--Acts 13:3
%
The two of them, sent on their way by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia 
and sailed from there to Cyprus.
	--Acts 13:4

When they arrived at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish 
synagogues. John was with them as their helper.
	--Acts 13:5
%
They traveled through the whole island until they came to Paphos. There they 
met a Jewish sorcerer and false prophet named Bar-Jesus,
	--Acts 13:6
%
who was an attendant of the proconsul, Sergius Paulus. The proconsul, an 
intelligent man, sent for Barnabas and Saul because he wanted to hear the word 
of God.
	--Acts 13:7
%
But Elymas the sorcerer (for that is what his name means) opposed them and 
tried to turn the proconsul from the faith.
	--Acts 13:8
%
Then Saul, who was also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked 
straight at Elymas and said,
	--Acts 13:9
%
“You are a child of the devil and an enemy of everything that is right! You 
are full of all kinds of deceit and trickery. Will you never stop perverting 
the right ways of the Lord?
	--Acts 13:10
%
Now the hand of the Lord is against you. You are going to be blind for a time, 
not even able to see the light of the sun.” Immediately mist and darkness 
came over him, and he groped about, seeking someone to lead him by the hand.
	--Acts 13:11
%
When the proconsul saw what had happened, he believed, for he was amazed at the 
teaching about the Lord.
	--Acts 13:12
%
From Paphos, Paul and his companions sailed to Perga in Pamphylia, where John 
left them to return to Jerusalem.
	--Acts 13:13
%
From Perga they went on to Pisidian Antioch. On the Sabbath they entered the 
synagogue and sat down.
	--Acts 13:14
%
After the reading from the Law and the Prophets, the leaders of the synagogue 
sent word to them, saying, “Brothers, if you have a word of exhortation for 
the people, please speak.”
	--Acts 13:15
%
Standing up, Paul motioned with his hand and said: “Fellow Israelites and you 
Gentiles who worship God, listen to me!
	--Acts 13:16
%
The God of the people of Israel chose our ancestors; he made the people prosper 
during their stay in Egypt; with mighty power he led them out of that country;
	--Acts 13:17
%
for about forty years he endured their conduct in the wilderness;
	--Acts 13:18
%
and he overthrew seven nations in Canaan, giving their land to his people as 
their inheritance.
	--Acts 13:19
%
All this took about 450 years. “After this, God gave them judges until the 
time of Samuel the prophet.
	--Acts 13:20
%
Then the people asked for a king, and he gave them Saul son of Kish, of the 
tribe of Benjamin, who ruled forty years.
	--Acts 13:21
%
After removing Saul, he made David their king. God testified concerning him: 
‘I have found David son of Jesse, a man after my own heart; he will do 
everything I want him to do.’
	--Acts 13:22
%
“From this man’s descendants God has brought to Israel the Savior Jesus, as 
he promised.
	--Acts 13:23
%
Before the coming of Jesus, John preached repentance and baptism to all the 
people of Israel.
	--Acts 13:24
%
As John was completing his work, he said: ‘Who do you suppose I am? I am not 
the one you are looking for. But there is one coming after me whose sandals I 
am not worthy to untie.’

%
“Fellow children of Abraham and you God-fearing Gentiles, it is to us that 
this message of salvation has been sent.

The people of Jerusalem and their rulers did not recognize Jesus, yet in 
condemning him they fulfilled the words of the prophets that are read every 
Sabbath.
	--Acts 13:27
%
Though they found no proper ground for a death sentence, they asked Pilate to 
have him executed.
	--Acts 13:28
%
When they had carried out all that was written about him, they took him down 
from the cross and laid him in a tomb.
	--Acts 13:29
%
But God raised him from the dead,
	--Acts 13:30
%
and for many days he was seen by those who had traveled with him from Galilee 
to Jerusalem. They are now his witnesses to our people.
	--Acts 13:31
%
“We tell you the good news: What God promised our ancestors
	--Acts 13:32
%
he has fulfilled for us, their children, by raising up Jesus. As it is written 
in the second Psalm: “‘You are my son; today I have become your father.’
	--Acts 13:33
%
God raised him from the dead so that he will never be subject to decay. As God 
has said, “‘I will give you the holy and sure blessings promised to 
David.’
	--Acts 13:34
%
So it is also stated elsewhere: “‘You will not let your holy one see 
decay.’
	--Acts 13:35
%
“Now when David had served God’s purpose in his own generation, he fell 
asleep; he was buried with his ancestors and his body decayed.
	--Acts 13:36
%
But the one whom God raised from the dead did not see decay.
	--Acts 13:37
%
“Therefore, my friends, I want you to know that through Jesus the forgiveness 
of sins is proclaimed to you.
	--Acts 13:38
%
Through him everyone who believes is set free from every sin, a justification 
you were not able to obtain under the law of Moses.
	--Acts 13:39
%
Take care that what the prophets have said does not happen to you:
	--Acts 13:40
%
“‘Look, you scoffers, wonder and perish, for I am going to do something in 
your days that you would never believe, even if someone told you.’”
	--Acts 13:41
%
As Paul and Barnabas were leaving the synagogue, the people invited them to 
speak further about these things on the next Sabbath.
	--Acts 13:42
%
When the congregation was dismissed, many of the Jews and devout converts to 
Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who talked with them and urged them to 
continue in the grace of God.
	--Acts 13:43
%
On the next Sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord.
	--Acts 13:44
%
When the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy. They began to 
contradict what Paul was saying and heaped abuse on him.
	--Acts 13:45
%
Then Paul and Barnabas answered them boldly: “We had to speak the word of God 
to you first. Since you reject it and do not consider yourselves worthy of 
eternal life, we now turn to the Gentiles.
	--Acts 13:46
%
For this is what the Lord has commanded us: “‘I have made you a light for 
the Gentiles, that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.’”
	--Acts 13:47
%
When the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and honored the word of the Lord; 
and all who were appointed for eternal life believed.
	--Acts 13:48
%
The word of the Lord spread through the whole region.
	--Acts 13:49
%
But the Jewish leaders incited the God-fearing women of high standing and the 
leading men of the city. They stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, 
and expelled them from their region.
	--Acts 13:50
%
So they shook the dust off their feet as a warning to them and went to Iconium.
	--Acts 13:51
%
And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.
	--Acts 13:52
%
At Iconium Paul and Barnabas went as usual into the Jewish synagogue. There 
they spoke so effectively that a great number of Jews and Greeks believed.
	--Acts 14:1
%
But the Jews who refused to believe stirred up the other Gentiles and poisoned 
their minds against the brothers.
	--Acts 14:2
%
So Paul and Barnabas spent considerable time there, speaking boldly for the 
Lord, who confirmed the message of his grace by enabling them to perform signs 
and wonders.
	--Acts 14:3
%
The people of the city were divided; some sided with the Jews, others with the 
apostles.
	--Acts 14:4
%
There was a plot afoot among both Gentiles and Jews, together with their 
leaders, to mistreat them and stone them.
	--Acts 14:5
%
But they found out about it and fled to the Lycaonian cities of Lystra and 
Derbe and to the surrounding country,
	--Acts 14:6
%
where they continued to preach the gospel.
	--Acts 14:7
%
In Lystra there sat a man who was lame. He had been that way from birth and had 
never walked.
	--Acts 14:8
%
He listened to Paul as he was speaking. Paul looked directly at him, saw that 
he had faith to be healed
	--Acts 14:9
%
and called out, “Stand up on your feet!” At that, the man jumped up and 
began to walk.
	--Acts 14:10
%
When the crowd saw what Paul had done, they shouted in the Lycaonian language, 
“The gods have come down to us in human form!”
	--Acts 14:11
%
Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul they called Hermes because he was the chief 
speaker.
	--Acts 14:12
%
The priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the city, brought bulls and 
wreaths to the city gates because he and the crowd wanted to offer sacrifices 
to them.
	--Acts 14:13
%
But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of this, they tore their clothes 
and rushed out into the crowd, shouting:
	--Acts 14:14
%
“Friends, why are you doing this? We too are only human, like you. We are 
bringing you good news, telling you to turn from these worthless things to the 
living God, who made the heavens and the earth and the sea and everything in 
them.
	--Acts 14:15
%
In the past, he let all nations go their own way.
	--Acts 14:16
%
Yet he has not left himself without testimony: He has shown kindness by giving 
you rain from heaven and crops in their seasons; he provides you with plenty of 
food and fills your hearts with joy.”
	--Acts 14:17
%
Even with these words, they had difficulty keeping the crowd from sacrificing 
to them.
	--Acts 14:18
%
Then some Jews came from Antioch and Iconium and won the crowd over. They 
stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city, thinking he was dead.
	--Acts 14:19
%
But after the disciples had gathered around him, he got up and went back into 
the city. The next day he and Barnabas left for Derbe.
	--Acts 14:20
%
They preached the gospel in that city and won a large number of disciples. Then 
they returned to Lystra, Iconium and Antioch,
	--Acts 14:21
%
strengthening the disciples and encouraging them to remain true to the faith. 
“We must go through many hardships to enter the kingdom of God,” they said.
	--Acts 14:22
%
Paul and Barnabas appointed elders for them in each church and, with prayer and 
fasting, committed them to the Lord, in whom they had put their trust.
	--Acts 14:23
%
After going through Pisidia, they came into Pamphylia,
	--Acts 14:24
%
and when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.
	--Acts 14:25
%
From Attalia they sailed back to Antioch, where they had been committed to the 
grace of God for the work they had now completed.
	--Acts 14:26
%
On arriving there, they gathered the church together and reported all that God 
had done through them and how he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.
	--Acts 14:27
%
And they stayed there a long time with the disciples.
	--Acts 14:28
%
Certain people came down from Judea to Antioch and were teaching the believers: 
“Unless you are circumcised, according to the custom taught by Moses, you 
cannot be saved.”
	--Acts 15:1
%
This brought Paul and Barnabas into sharp dispute and debate with them. So Paul 
and Barnabas were appointed, along with some other believers, to go up to 
Jerusalem to see the apostles and elders about this question.
	--Acts 15:2
%
The church sent them on their way, and as they traveled through Phoenicia and 
Samaria, they told how the Gentiles had been converted. This news made all the 
believers very glad.
	--Acts 15:3
%
When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles 
and elders, to whom they reported everything God had done through them.
	--Acts 15:4
%
Then some of the believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees stood up 
and said, “The Gentiles must be circumcised and required to keep the law of 
Moses.”
	--Acts 15:5
%
The apostles and elders met to consider this question.
	--Acts 15:6
%
After much discussion, Peter got up and addressed them: “Brothers, you know 
that some time ago God made a choice among you that the Gentiles might hear 
from my lips the message of the gospel and believe.
	--Acts 15:7
%
God, who knows the heart, showed that he accepted them by giving the Holy 
Spirit to them, just as he did to us.
	--Acts 15:8
%
He did not discriminate between us and them, for he purified their hearts by 
faith.
	--Acts 15:9
%
Now then, why do you try to test God by putting on the necks of Gentiles a yoke 
that neither we nor our ancestors have been able to bear?
	--Acts 15:10
%
No! We believe it is through the grace of our Lord Jesus that we are saved, 
just as they are.”
	--Acts 15:11
%
The whole assembly became silent as they listened to Barnabas and Paul telling 
about the signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them.
	--Acts 15:12
%
When they finished, James spoke up. “Brothers,” he said, “listen to me.
	--Acts 15:13
%
Simon has described to us how God first intervened to choose a people for his 
name from the Gentiles.
	--Acts 15:14
%
The words of the prophets are in agreement with this, as it is written:
	--Acts 15:15
%
“‘After this I will return and rebuild David’s fallen tent. Its ruins I 
will rebuild, and I will restore it,
	--Acts 15:16
%
that the rest of mankind may seek the Lord, even all the Gentiles who bear my 
name, says the Lord, who does these things’—
	--Acts 15:17
%
    things known from long ago.
	--Acts 15:18
%
“It is my judgment, therefore, that we should not make it difficult for the 
Gentiles who are turning to God.
	--Acts 15:19
%
Instead we should write to them, telling them to abstain from food polluted by 
idols, from sexual immorality, from the meat of strangled animals and from 
blood.
	--Acts 15:20
%
For the law of Moses has been preached in every city from the earliest times 
and is read in the synagogues on every Sabbath.”
	--Acts 15:21
%
Then the apostles and elders, with the whole church, decided to choose some of 
their own men and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They chose Judas 
(called Barsabbas) and Silas, men who were leaders among the believers.
	--Acts 15:22
%
With them they sent the following letter: The apostles and elders, your 
brothers, To the Gentile believers in Antioch, Syria and Cilicia: Greetings.
	--Acts 15:23
%
We have heard that some went out from us without our authorization and 
disturbed you, troubling your minds by what they said.
	--Acts 15:24
%
So we all agreed to choose some men and send them to you with our dear friends 
Barnabas and Paul—
	--Acts 15:25
%
men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
	--Acts 15:26
%
Therefore we are sending Judas and Silas to confirm by word of mouth what we 
are writing.
	--Acts 15:27
%
It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to burden you with anything 
beyond the following requirements:
	--Acts 15:28
%
You are to abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of 
strangled animals and from sexual immorality. You will do well to avoid these 
things. Farewell.
	--Acts 15:29
%
So the men were sent off and went down to Antioch, where they gathered the 
church together and delivered the letter.
	--Acts 15:30
%
The people read it and were glad for its encouraging message.
	--Acts 15:31
%
Judas and Silas, who themselves were prophets, said much to encourage and 
strengthen the believers.
	--Acts 15:32
%
After spending some time there, they were sent off by the believers with the 
blessing of peace to return to those who had sent them.
	--Acts 15:33
%

	--Acts 15:34
%
But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, where they and many others taught 
and preached the word of the Lord.
	--Acts 15:35
%
Some time later Paul said to Barnabas, “Let us go back and visit the 
believers in all the towns where we preached the word of the Lord and see how 
they are doing.”
	--Acts 15:36
%
Barnabas wanted to take John, also called Mark, with them,
	--Acts 15:37
%
but Paul did not think it wise to take him, because he had deserted them in 
Pamphylia and had not continued with them in the work.
	--Acts 15:38
%
They had such a sharp disagreement that they parted company. Barnabas took Mark 
and sailed for Cyprus,
	--Acts 15:39
%
but Paul chose Silas and left, commended by the believers to the grace of the 
Lord.
	--Acts 15:40
%
He went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.
	--Acts 15:41
%
Paul came to Derbe and then to Lystra, where a disciple named Timothy lived, 
whose mother was Jewish and a believer but whose father was a Greek.
	--Acts 16:1
%
The believers at Lystra and Iconium spoke well of him.
	--Acts 16:2
%
Paul wanted to take him along on the journey, so he circumcised him because of 
the Jews who lived in that area, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.
	--Acts 16:3
%
As they traveled from town to town, they delivered the decisions reached by the 
apostles and elders in Jerusalem for the people to obey.
	--Acts 16:4
%
So the churches were strengthened in the faith and grew daily in numbers.
	--Acts 16:5
%
Paul and his companions traveled throughout the region of Phrygia and Galatia, 
having been kept by the Holy Spirit from preaching the word in the province of 
Asia.
	--Acts 16:6
%
When they came to the border of Mysia, they tried to enter Bithynia, but the 
Spirit of Jesus would not allow them to.
	--Acts 16:7
%
So they passed by Mysia and went down to Troas.
	--Acts 16:8
%
During the night Paul had a vision of a man of Macedonia standing and begging 
him, “Come over to Macedonia and help us.”
	--Acts 16:9
%
After Paul had seen the vision, we got ready at once to leave for Macedonia, 
concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.
	--Acts 16:10
%
From Troas we put out to sea and sailed straight for Samothrace, and the next 
day we went on to Neapolis.
	--Acts 16:11
%
From there we traveled to Philippi, a Roman colony and the leading city of that 
district of Macedonia. And we stayed there several days.
	--Acts 16:12
%
On the Sabbath we went outside the city gate to the river, where we expected to 
find a place of prayer. We sat down and began to speak to the women who had 
gathered there.
	--Acts 16:13
%
One of those listening was a woman from the city of Thyatira named Lydia, a 
dealer in purple cloth. She was a worshiper of God. The Lord opened her heart 
to respond to Paul’s message.
	--Acts 16:14
%
When she and the members of her household were baptized, she invited us to her 
home. “If you consider me a believer in the Lord,” she said, “come and 
stay at my house.” And she persuaded us.
	--Acts 16:15
%
Once when we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a female slave 
who had a spirit by which she predicted the future. She earned a great deal of 
money for her owners by fortune-telling.
	--Acts 16:16
%
She followed Paul and the rest of us, shouting, “These men are servants of 
the Most High God, who are telling you the way to be saved.”
	--Acts 16:17
%
She kept this up for many days. Finally Paul became so annoyed that he turned 
around and said to the spirit, “In the name of Jesus Christ I command you to 
come out of her!” At that moment the spirit left her.
	--Acts 16:18
%
When her owners realized that their hope of making money was gone, they seized 
Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace to face the authorities.
	--Acts 16:19
%
They brought them before the magistrates and said, “These men are Jews, and 
are throwing our city into an uproar
	--Acts 16:20
%
by advocating customs unlawful for us Romans to accept or practice.”
	--Acts 16:21
%
The crowd joined in the attack against Paul and Silas, and the magistrates 
ordered them to be stripped and beaten with rods.
	--Acts 16:22
%
After they had been severely flogged, they were thrown into prison, and the 
jailer was commanded to guard them carefully.
	--Acts 16:23
%
When he received these orders, he put them in the inner cell and fastened their 
feet in the stocks.
	--Acts 16:24
%
About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the 
other prisoners were listening to them.
	--Acts 16:25
%
Suddenly there was such a violent earthquake that the foundations of the prison 
were shaken. At once all the prison doors flew open, and everyone’s chains 
came loose.
	--Acts 16:26
%
The jailer woke up, and when he saw the prison doors open, he drew his sword 
and was about to kill himself because he thought the prisoners had escaped.
	--Acts 16:27
%
But Paul shouted, “Don’t harm yourself! We are all here!”
	--Acts 16:28
%
The jailer called for lights, rushed in and fell trembling before Paul and 
Silas.
	--Acts 16:29
%
He then brought them out and asked, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?”
	--Acts 16:30
%
They replied, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved—you and 
your household.”
	--Acts 16:31
%
Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all the others in his house.
	--Acts 16:32
%
At that hour of the night the jailer took them and washed their wounds; then 
immediately he and all his household were baptized.
	--Acts 16:33
%
The jailer brought them into his house and set a meal before them; he was 
filled with joy because he had come to believe in God—he and his whole 
household.
	--Acts 16:34
%
When it was daylight, the magistrates sent their officers to the jailer with 
the order: “Release those men.”
	--Acts 16:35
%
The jailer told Paul, “The magistrates have ordered that you and Silas be 
released. Now you can leave. Go in peace.”
	--Acts 16:36
%
But Paul said to the officers: “They beat us publicly without a trial, even 
though we are Roman citizens, and threw us into prison. And now do they want to 
get rid of us quietly? No! Let them come themselves and escort us out.”
	--Acts 16:37
%
The officers reported this to the magistrates, and when they heard that Paul 
and Silas were Roman citizens, they were alarmed.
	--Acts 16:38
%
They came to appease them and escorted them from the prison, requesting them to 
leave the city.
	--Acts 16:39
%
After Paul and Silas came out of the prison, they went to Lydia’s house, 
where they met with the brothers and sisters and encouraged them. Then they 
left.
	--Acts 16:40
%
When Paul and his companions had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they 
came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue.
	--Acts 17:1
%
As was his custom, Paul went into the synagogue, and on three Sabbath days he 
reasoned with them from the Scriptures,
	--Acts 17:2
%
explaining and proving that the Messiah had to suffer and rise from the dead. 
“This Jesus I am proclaiming to you is the Messiah,” he said.
	--Acts 17:3
%
Some of the Jews were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, as did a large 
number of God-fearing Greeks and quite a few prominent women.
	--Acts 17:4
%
But other Jews were jealous; so they rounded up some bad characters from the 
marketplace, formed a mob and started a riot in the city. They rushed to 
Jason’s house in search of Paul and Silas in order to bring them out to the 
crowd.
	--Acts 17:5
%
But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some other believers 
before the city officials, shouting: “These men who have caused trouble all 
over the world have now come here,
	--Acts 17:6
%
and Jason has welcomed them into his house. They are all defying Caesar’s 
decrees, saying that there is another king, one called Jesus.”
	--Acts 17:7
%
When they heard this, the crowd and the city officials were thrown into turmoil.
	--Acts 17:8
%
Then they made Jason and the others post bond and let them go.
	--Acts 17:9
%
As soon as it was night, the believers sent Paul and Silas away to Berea. On 
arriving there, they went to the Jewish synagogue.
	--Acts 17:10
%
Now the Berean Jews were of more noble character than those in Thessalonica, 
for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures 
every day to see if what Paul said was true.
	--Acts 17:11
%
As a result, many of them believed, as did also a number of prominent Greek 
women and many Greek men.
	--Acts 17:12
%
But when the Jews in Thessalonica learned that Paul was preaching the word of 
God at Berea, some of them went there too, agitating the crowds and stirring 
them up.
	--Acts 17:13
%
The believers immediately sent Paul to the coast, but Silas and Timothy stayed 
at Berea.
	--Acts 17:14
%
Those who escorted Paul brought him to Athens and then left with instructions 
for Silas and Timothy to join him as soon as possible.
	--Acts 17:15
%
While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, he was greatly distressed to see 
that the city was full of idols.
	--Acts 17:16
%
So he reasoned in the synagogue with both Jews and God-fearing Greeks, as well 
as in the marketplace day by day with those who happened to be there.
	--Acts 17:17
%
A group of Epicurean and Stoic philosophers began to debate with him. Some of 
them asked, “What is this babbler trying to say?” Others remarked, “He 
seems to be advocating foreign gods.” They said this because Paul was 
preaching the good news about Jesus and the resurrection.
	--Acts 17:18
%
Then they took him and brought him to a meeting of the Areopagus, where they 
said to him, “May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting?
	--Acts 17:19
%
You are bringing some strange ideas to our ears, and we would like to know what 
they mean.”
	--Acts 17:20
%
(All the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there spent their time doing 
nothing but talking about and listening to the latest ideas.)
	--Acts 17:21
%
Paul then stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus and said: “People of 
Athens! I see that in every way you are very religious.
	--Acts 17:22
%
For as I walked around and looked carefully at your objects of worship, I even 
found an altar with this inscription: to an unknown god. So you are ignorant of 
the very thing you worship—and this is what I am going to proclaim to you.
	--Acts 17:23
%
“The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and 
earth and does not live in temples built by human hands.
	--Acts 17:24
%
And he is not served by human hands, as if he needed anything. Rather, he 
himself gives everyone life and breath and everything else.
	--Acts 17:25
%
From one man he made all the nations, that they should inhabit the whole earth; 
and he marked out their appointed times in history and the boundaries of their 
lands.
	--Acts 17:26
%
God did this so that they would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find 
him, though he is not far from any one of us.
	--Acts 17:27
%
‘For in him we live and move and have our being.’ As some of your own poets 
have said, ‘We are his offspring.’
	--Acts 17:28
%
“Therefore since we are God’s offspring, we should not think that the 
divine being is like gold or silver or stone—an image made by human design 
and skill.
	--Acts 17:29
%
In the past God overlooked such ignorance, but now he commands all people 
everywhere to repent.
	--Acts 17:30
%
For he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he 
has appointed. He has given proof of this to everyone by raising him from the 
dead.”
	--Acts 17:31
%
When they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some of them sneered, but 
others said, “We want to hear you again on this subject.”
	--Acts 17:32
%
At that, Paul left the Council.
	--Acts 17:33
%
Some of the people became followers of Paul and believed. Among them was 
Dionysius, a member of the Areopagus, also a woman named Damaris, and a number 
of others.
	--Acts 17:34
%
After this, Paul left Athens and went to Corinth.
	--Acts 18:1
%
There he met a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently come from 
Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had ordered all Jews to leave 
Rome. Paul went to see them,
	--Acts 18:2
%
and because he was a tentmaker as they were, he stayed and worked with them.
	--Acts 18:3
%
Every Sabbath he reasoned in the synagogue, trying to persuade Jews and Greeks.
	--Acts 18:4
%
When Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself exclusively to 
preaching, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Messiah.
	--Acts 18:5
%
But when they opposed Paul and became abusive, he shook out his clothes in 
protest and said to them, “Your blood be on your own heads! I am innocent of 
it. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.”
	--Acts 18:6
%
Then Paul left the synagogue and went next door to the house of Titius Justus, 
a worshiper of God.
	--Acts 18:7
%
Crispus, the synagogue leader, and his entire household believed in the Lord; 
and many of the Corinthians who heard Paul believed and were baptized.
	--Acts 18:8
%
One night the Lord spoke to Paul in a vision: “Do not be afraid; keep on 
speaking, do not be silent.
	--Acts 18:9
%
For I am with you, and no one is going to attack and harm you, because I have 
many people in this city.”
	--Acts 18:10
%
So Paul stayed in Corinth for a year and a half, teaching them the word of God.
	--Acts 18:11
%
While Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews of Corinth made a united attack 
on Paul and brought him to the place of judgment.
	--Acts 18:12
%
“This man,” they charged, “is persuading the people to worship God in 
ways contrary to the law.”
	--Acts 18:13
%
Just as Paul was about to speak, Gallio said to them, “If you Jews were 
making a complaint about some misdemeanor or serious crime, it would be 
reasonable for me to listen to you.
	--Acts 18:14
%
But since it involves questions about words and names and your own law—settle 
the matter yourselves. I will not be a judge of such things.”
	--Acts 18:15
%
So he drove them off.
	--Acts 18:16
%
Then the crowd there turned on Sosthenes the synagogue leader and beat him in 
front of the proconsul; and Gallio showed no concern whatever.
	--Acts 18:17
%
Paul stayed on in Corinth for some time. Then he left the brothers and sisters 
and sailed for Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. Before he sailed, he 
had his hair cut off at Cenchreae because of a vow he had taken.
	--Acts 18:18
%
They arrived at Ephesus, where Paul left Priscilla and Aquila. He himself went 
into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.
	--Acts 18:19
%
When they asked him to spend more time with them, he declined.
	--Acts 18:20
%
But as he left, he promised, “I will come back if it is God’s will.” Then 
he set sail from Ephesus.
	--Acts 18:21
%
When he landed at Caesarea, he went up to Jerusalem and greeted the church and 
then went down to Antioch.
	--Acts 18:22
%
After spending some time in Antioch, Paul set out from there and traveled from 
place to place throughout the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all 
the disciples.
	--Acts 18:23
%
Meanwhile a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was 
a learned man, with a thorough knowledge of the Scriptures.
	--Acts 18:24
%
He had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and he spoke with great fervor 
and taught about Jesus accurately, though he knew only the baptism of John.
	--Acts 18:25
%
He began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, 
they invited him to their home and explained to him the way of God more 
adequately.
	--Acts 18:26
%
When Apollos wanted to go to Achaia, the brothers and sisters encouraged him 
and wrote to the disciples there to welcome him. When he arrived, he was a 
great help to those who by grace had believed.
	--Acts 18:27
%
For he vigorously refuted his Jewish opponents in public debate, proving from 
the Scriptures that Jesus was the Messiah.
	--Acts 18:28
%
While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul took the road through the interior and 
arrived at Ephesus. There he found some disciples
	--Acts 19:1
%
and asked them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?” They 
answered, “No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.”
	--Acts 19:2
%
So Paul asked, “Then what baptism did you receive?” “John’s baptism,” 
they replied.
	--Acts 19:3
%
Paul said, “John’s baptism was a baptism of repentance. He told the people 
to believe in the one coming after him, that is, in Jesus.”
	--Acts 19:4
%
On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
	--Acts 19:5
%
When Paul placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they 
spoke in tongues and prophesied.
	--Acts 19:6
%
There were about twelve men in all.
	--Acts 19:7
%
Paul entered the synagogue and spoke boldly there for three months, arguing 
persuasively about the kingdom of God.
	--Acts 19:8
%
But some of them became obstinate; they refused to believe and publicly 
maligned the Way. So Paul left them. He took the disciples with him and had 
discussions daily in the lecture hall of Tyrannus.
	--Acts 19:9
%
This went on for two years, so that all the Jews and Greeks who lived in the 
province of Asia heard the word of the Lord.
	--Acts 19:10
%
God did extraordinary miracles through Paul,
	--Acts 19:11
%
so that even handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him were taken to the 
sick, and their illnesses were cured and the evil spirits left them.
	--Acts 19:12
%
Some Jews who went around driving out evil spirits tried to invoke the name of 
the Lord Jesus over those who were demon-possessed. They would say, “In the 
name of the Jesus whom Paul preaches, I command you to come out.”
	--Acts 19:13
%
Seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this.
	--Acts 19:14
%
One day the evil spirit answered them, “Jesus I know, and Paul I know about, 
but who are you?”
	--Acts 19:15
%
Then the man who had the evil spirit jumped on them and overpowered them all. 
He gave them such a beating that they ran out of the house naked and bleeding.
	--Acts 19:16
%
When this became known to the Jews and Greeks living in Ephesus, they were all 
seized with fear, and the name of the Lord Jesus was held in high honor.
	--Acts 19:17
%
Many of those who believed now came and openly confessed what they had done.
	--Acts 19:18
%
A number who had practiced sorcery brought their scrolls together and burned 
them publicly. When they calculated the value of the scrolls, the total came to 
fifty thousand drachmas.
	--Acts 19:19
%
In this way the word of the Lord spread widely and grew in power.
	--Acts 19:20
%
After all this had happened, Paul decided to go to Jerusalem, passing through 
Macedonia and Achaia. “After I have been there,” he said, “I must visit 
Rome also.”
	--Acts 19:21
%
He sent two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, while he stayed 
in the province of Asia a little longer.
	--Acts 19:22
%
About that time there arose a great disturbance about the Way.
	--Acts 19:23
%
A silversmith named Demetrius, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought in a 
lot of business for the craftsmen there.
	--Acts 19:24
%
He called them together, along with the workers in related trades, and said: 
“You know, my friends, that we receive a good income from this business.
	--Acts 19:25
%
And you see and hear how this fellow Paul has convinced and led astray large 
numbers of people here in Ephesus and in practically the whole province of 
Asia. He says that gods made by human hands are no gods at all.
	--Acts 19:26
%
There is danger not only that our trade will lose its good name, but also that 
the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be discredited; and the goddess 
herself, who is worshiped throughout the province of Asia and the world, will 
be robbed of her divine majesty.”
	--Acts 19:27
%
When they heard this, they were furious and began shouting: “Great is Artemis 
of the Ephesians!”
	--Acts 19:28
%
Soon the whole city was in an uproar. The people seized Gaius and Aristarchus, 
Paul’s traveling companions from Macedonia, and all of them rushed into the 
theater together.
	--Acts 19:29
%
Paul wanted to appear before the crowd, but the disciples would not let him.
	--Acts 19:30
%
Even some of the officials of the province, friends of Paul, sent him a message 
begging him not to venture into the theater.
	--Acts 19:31
%
The assembly was in confusion: Some were shouting one thing, some another. Most 
of the people did not even know why they were there.
	--Acts 19:32
%
The Jews in the crowd pushed Alexander to the front, and they shouted 
instructions to him. He motioned for silence in order to make a defense before 
the people.
	--Acts 19:33
%
But when they realized he was a Jew, they all shouted in unison for about two 
hours: “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”
	--Acts 19:34
%
The city clerk quieted the crowd and said: “Fellow Ephesians, doesn’t all 
the world know that the city of Ephesus is the guardian of the temple of the 
great Artemis and of her image, which fell from heaven?
	--Acts 19:35
%
Therefore, since these facts are undeniable, you ought to calm down and not do 
anything rash.
	--Acts 19:36
%
You have brought these men here, though they have neither robbed temples nor 
blasphemed our goddess.
	--Acts 19:37
%
If, then, Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen have a grievance against anybody, 
the courts are open and there are proconsuls. They can press charges.
	--Acts 19:38
%
If there is anything further you want to bring up, it must be settled in a 
legal assembly.
	--Acts 19:39
%
As it is, we are in danger of being charged with rioting because of what 
happened today. In that case we would not be able to account for this 
commotion, since there is no reason for it.”
	--Acts 19:40
%
After he had said this, he dismissed the assembly.
	--Acts 19:41
%
When the uproar had ended, Paul sent for the disciples and, after encouraging 
them, said goodbye and set out for Macedonia.
	--Acts 20:1
%
He traveled through that area, speaking many words of encouragement to the 
people, and finally arrived in Greece,
	--Acts 20:2
%
where he stayed three months. Because some Jews had plotted against him just as 
he was about to sail for Syria, he decided to go back through Macedonia.
	--Acts 20:3
%
He was accompanied by Sopater son of Pyrrhus from Berea, Aristarchus and 
Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius from Derbe, Timothy also, and Tychicus and 
Trophimus from the province of Asia.
	--Acts 20:4
%
These men went on ahead and waited for us at Troas.
	--Acts 20:5
%
But we sailed from Philippi after the Festival of Unleavened Bread, and five 
days later joined the others at Troas, where we stayed seven days.
	--Acts 20:6
%
On the first day of the week we came together to break bread. Paul spoke to the 
people and, because he intended to leave the next day, kept on talking until 
midnight.
	--Acts 20:7
%
There were many lamps in the upstairs room where we were meeting.
	--Acts 20:8
%
Seated in a window was a young man named Eutychus, who was sinking into a deep 
sleep as Paul talked on and on. When he was sound asleep, he fell to the ground 
from the third story and was picked up dead.
	--Acts 20:9
%
Paul went down, threw himself on the young man and put his arms around him. 
“Don’t be alarmed,” he said. “He’s alive!”
	--Acts 20:10
%
Then he went upstairs again and broke bread and ate. After talking until 
daylight, he left.
	--Acts 20:11
%
The people took the young man home alive and were greatly comforted.
	--Acts 20:12
%
We went on ahead to the ship and sailed for Assos, where we were going to take 
Paul aboard. He had made this arrangement because he was going there on foot.
	--Acts 20:13
%
When he met us at Assos, we took him aboard and went on to Mitylene.
	--Acts 20:14
%
The next day we set sail from there and arrived off Chios. The day after that 
we crossed over to Samos, and on the following day arrived at Miletus.
	--Acts 20:15
%
Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus to avoid spending time in the province of 
Asia, for he was in a hurry to reach Jerusalem, if possible, by the day of 
Pentecost.
	--Acts 20:16
%
From Miletus, Paul sent to Ephesus for the elders of the church.
	--Acts 20:17
%
When they arrived, he said to them: “You know how I lived the whole time I 
was with you, from the first day I came into the province of Asia.
	--Acts 20:18
%
I served the Lord with great humility and with tears and in the midst of severe 
testing by the plots of my Jewish opponents.
	--Acts 20:19
%
You know that I have not hesitated to preach anything that would be helpful to 
you but have taught you publicly and from house to house.
	--Acts 20:20
%
I have declared to both Jews and Greeks that they must turn to God in 
repentance and have faith in our Lord Jesus.
	--Acts 20:21
%
“And now, compelled by the Spirit, I am going to Jerusalem, not knowing what 
will happen to me there.
	--Acts 20:22
%
I only know that in every city the Holy Spirit warns me that prison and 
hardships are facing me.
	--Acts 20:23
%
However, I consider my life worth nothing to me; my only aim is to finish the 
race and complete the task the Lord Jesus has given me—the task of testifying 
to the good news of God’s grace.
	--Acts 20:24
%
“Now I know that none of you among whom I have gone about preaching the 
kingdom will ever see me again.
	--Acts 20:25
%
Therefore, I declare to you today that I am innocent of the blood of any of you.
	--Acts 20:26
%
For I have not hesitated to proclaim to you the whole will of God.
	--Acts 20:27
%
Keep watch over yourselves and all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made 
you overseers. Be shepherds of the church of God, which he bought with his own 
blood.
	--Acts 20:28
%
I know that after I leave, savage wolves will come in among you and will not 
spare the flock.
	--Acts 20:29
%
Even from your own number men will arise and distort the truth in order to draw 
away disciples after them.
	--Acts 20:30
%
So be on your guard! Remember that for three years I never stopped warning each 
of you night and day with tears.
	--Acts 20:31
%
“Now I commit you to God and to the word of his grace, which can build you up 
and give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified.
	--Acts 20:32
%
I have not coveted anyone’s silver or gold or clothing.
	--Acts 20:33
%
You yourselves know that these hands of mine have supplied my own needs and the 
needs of my companions.
	--Acts 20:34
%
In everything I did, I showed you that by this kind of hard work we must help 
the weak, remembering the words the Lord Jesus himself said: ‘It is more 
blessed to give than to receive.’ ”
	--Acts 20:35
%
When Paul had finished speaking, he knelt down with all of them and prayed.
	--Acts 20:36
%
They all wept as they embraced him and kissed him.
	--Acts 20:37
%
What grieved them most was his statement that they would never see his face 
again. Then they accompanied him to the ship.
	--Acts 20:38
%
After we had torn ourselves away from them, we put out to sea and sailed 
straight to Kos. The next day we went to Rhodes and from there to Patara.
	--Acts 21:1
%
We found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, went on board and set sail.
	--Acts 21:2
%
After sighting Cyprus and passing to the south of it, we sailed on to Syria. We 
landed at Tyre, where our ship was to unload its cargo.
	--Acts 21:3
%
We sought out the disciples there and stayed with them seven days. Through the 
Spirit they urged Paul not to go on to Jerusalem.
	--Acts 21:4
%
When it was time to leave, we left and continued on our way. All of them, 
including wives and children, accompanied us out of the city, and there on the 
beach we knelt to pray.
	--Acts 21:5
%
After saying goodbye to each other, we went aboard the ship, and they returned 
home.
	--Acts 21:6
%
We continued our voyage from Tyre and landed at Ptolemais, where we greeted the 
brothers and sisters and stayed with them for a day.
	--Acts 21:7
%
Leaving the next day, we reached Caesarea and stayed at the house of Philip the 
evangelist, one of the Seven.
	--Acts 21:8
%
He had four unmarried daughters who prophesied.
	--Acts 21:9
%
After we had been there a number of days, a prophet named Agabus came down from 
Judea.
	--Acts 21:10
%
Coming over to us, he took Paul’s belt, tied his own hands and feet with it 
and said, “The Holy Spirit says, ‘In this way the Jewish leaders in 
Jerusalem will bind the owner of this belt and will hand him over to the 
Gentiles.’”
	--Acts 21:11
%
When we heard this, we and the people there pleaded with Paul not to go up to 
Jerusalem.
	--Acts 21:12
%
	--Acts 21:13
%
When he would not be dissuaded, we gave up and said, “The Lord’s will be 
done.”
	--Acts 21:14
%
After this, we started on our way up to Jerusalem.
	--Acts 21:15
%
Some of the disciples from Caesarea accompanied us and brought us to the home 
of Mnason, where we were to stay. He was a man from Cyprus and one of the early 
disciples.
	--Acts 21:16
%
When we arrived at Jerusalem, the brothers and sisters received us warmly.
	--Acts 21:17
%
	--Acts 21:18
%
	--Acts 21:19
%
When they heard this, they praised God. Then they said to Paul: “You see, 
brother, how many thousands of Jews have believed, and all of them are zealous 
for the law.
	--Acts 21:20
%
They have been informed that you teach all the Jews who live among the Gentiles 
to turn away from Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or live 
according to our customs.
	--Acts 21:21
%
	--Acts 21:22
%
so do what we tell you. There are four men with us who have made a vow.
	--Acts 21:23
%
Take these men, join in their purification rites and pay their expenses, so 
that they can have their heads shaved. Then everyone will know there is no 
truth in these reports about you, but that you yourself are living in obedience 
to the law.
	--Acts 21:24
%
As for the Gentile believers, we have written to them our decision that they 
should abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of 
strangled animals and from sexual immorality.”

%
(They had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with Paul and 
assumed that Paul had brought him into the temple.)
	--Acts 21:29
%
The whole city was aroused, and the people came running from all directions. 
Seizing Paul, they dragged him from the temple, and immediately the gates were 
shut.
	--Acts 21:30
%
	--Acts 21:31
%
	--Acts 21:32
%
The commander came up and arrested him and ordered him to be bound with two 
chains. Then he asked who he was and what he had done.
	--Acts 21:33
%
	--Acts 21:34
%
When Paul reached the steps, the violence of the mob was so great he had to be 
carried by the soldiers.
	--Acts 21:35
%
The crowd that followed kept shouting, “Get rid of him!”
	--Acts 21:36
%
As the soldiers were about to take Paul into the barracks, he asked the 
commander, “May I say something to you?” “Do you speak Greek?” he 
replied.
	--Acts 21:37
%
“Aren’t you the Egyptian who started a revolt and led four thousand 
terrorists out into the wilderness some time ago?”
	--Acts 21:38
%
Paul answered, “I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no ordinary 
city. Please let me speak to the people.”
	--Acts 21:39
%
After receiving the commander’s permission, Paul stood on the steps and 
motioned to the crowd. When they were all silent, he said to them in Aramaic:
	--Acts 21:40
%
22 “Brothers and fathers, listen now to my defense.”
	--Acts 22:1
%
	--Acts 22:2
%
“I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city. I 
studied under Gamaliel and was thoroughly trained in the law of our ancestors. 
I was just as zealous for God as any of you are today.

%
I persecuted the followers of this Way to their death, arresting both men and 
women and throwing them into prison,
	--Acts 22:4

as the high priest and all the Council can themselves testify. I even obtained 
letters from them to their associates in Damascus, and went there to bring 
these people as prisoners to Jerusalem to be punished.

My companions led me by the hand into Damascus, because the brilliance of the 
light had blinded me.

“A man named Ananias came to see me. He was a devout observer of the law and 
highly respected by all the Jews living there.

that very moment I was able to see him.

The crowd listened to Paul until he said this. Then they raised their voices 
and shouted, “Rid the earth of him! He’s not fit to live!”
	--Acts 22:22
%
As they were shouting and throwing off their cloaks and flinging dust into the 
air,
	--Acts 22:23
%
	--Acts 22:24
%
	--Acts 22:25
%
When the centurion heard this, he went to the commander and reported it. 
“What are you going to do?” he asked. “This man is a Roman citizen.”
	--Acts 22:26
%
The commander went to Paul and asked, “Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?” 
“Yes, I am,” he answered.
	--Acts 22:27
%
Then the commander said, “I had to pay a lot of money for my citizenship.” 
“But I was born a citizen,” Paul replied.
	--Acts 22:28
%
Those who were about to interrogate him withdrew immediately. The commander 
himself was alarmed when he realized that he had put Paul, a Roman citizen, in 
chains.
	--Acts 22:29
%
The commander wanted to find out exactly why Paul was being accused by the 
Jews. So the next day he released him and ordered the chief priests and all the 
members of the Sanhedrin to assemble. Then he brought Paul and had him stand 
before them.
	--Acts 22:30
%
Paul looked straight at the Sanhedrin and said, “My brothers, I have 
fulfilled my duty to God in all good conscience to this day.”
	--Acts 23:1
%
	--Acts 23:2
%
Then Paul said to him, “God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! You sit 
there to judge me according to the law, yet you yourself violate the law by 
commanding that I be struck!”
	--Acts 23:3
%
Those who were standing near Paul said, “How dare you insult God’s high 
priest!”
	--Acts 23:4
%
	--Acts 23:5
%
Then Paul, knowing that some of them were Sadducees and the others Pharisees, 
called out in the Sanhedrin, “My brothers, I am a Pharisee, descended from 
Pharisees. I stand on trial because of the hope of the resurrection of the 
dead.”
	--Acts 23:6
%
When he said this, a dispute broke out between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, 
and the assembly was divided.
	--Acts 23:7
%
(The Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, and that there are neither 
angels nor spirits, but the Pharisees believe all these things.)
	--Acts 23:8
%
There was a great uproar, and some of the teachers of the law who were 
Pharisees stood up and argued vigorously. “We find nothing wrong with this 
man,” they said. “What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?”
	--Acts 23:9
%
The dispute became so violent that the commander was afraid Paul would be torn 
to pieces by them. He ordered the troops to go down and take him away from them 
by force and bring him into the barracks.
	--Acts 23:10
%
	--Acts 23:11
%
The next morning some Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves with an 
oath not to eat or drink until they had killed Paul.
	--Acts 23:12
%
More than forty men were involved in this plot.
	--Acts 23:13
%
They went to the chief priests and the elders and said, “We have taken a 
solemn oath not to eat anything until we have killed Paul.
	--Acts 23:14
%
Now then, you and the Sanhedrin petition the commander to bring him before you 
on the pretext of wanting more accurate information about his case. We are 
ready to kill him before he gets here.”
	--Acts 23:15
%
But when the son of Paul’s sister heard of this plot, he went into the 
barracks and told Paul.
	--Acts 23:16
%
Then Paul called one of the centurions and said, “Take this young man to the 
commander; he has something to tell him.”
	--Acts 23:17
%
So he took him to the commander. The centurion said, “Paul, the prisoner, 
sent for me and asked me to bring this young man to you because he has 
something to tell you.”
	--Acts 23:18
%
The commander took the young man by the hand, drew him aside and asked, “What 
is it you want to tell me?”
	--Acts 23:19
%
He said: “Some Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul before the Sanhedrin 
tomorrow on the pretext of wanting more accurate information about him.
	--Acts 23:20
%
	--Acts 23:21
%
The commander dismissed the young man with this warning: “Don’t tell anyone 
that you have reported this to me.”
	--Acts 23:22
%
Then he called two of his centurions and ordered them, “Get ready a 
detachment of two hundred soldiers, seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen 
to go to Caesarea at nine tonight.
	--Acts 23:23
%
Provide horses for Paul so that he may be taken safely to Governor Felix.”
	--Acts 23:24
%
He wrote a letter as follows:
	--Acts 23:25
%
Claudius Lysias, To His Excellency, Governor Felix: Greetings.
	--Acts 23:26
%
This man was seized by the Jews and they were about to kill him, but I came 
with my troops and rescued him, for I had learned that he is a Roman citizen.
	--Acts 23:27
%
I wanted to know why they were accusing him, so I brought him to their 
Sanhedrin.
	--Acts 23:28
%
I found that the accusation had to do with questions about their law, but there 
was no charge against him that deserved death or imprisonment.
	--Acts 23:29
%
When I was informed of a plot to be carried out against the man, I sent him to 
you at once. I also ordered his accusers to present to you their case against 
him.
	--Acts 23:30
%
So the soldiers, carrying out their orders, took Paul with them during the 
night and brought him as far as Antipatris.
	--Acts 23:31
%
The next day they let the cavalry go on with him, while they returned to the 
barracks.
	--Acts 23:32
%
	--Acts 23:33
%
	--Acts 23:34
%
he said, “I will hear your case when your accusers get here.” Then he 
ordered that Paul be kept under guard in Herod’s palace.
	--Acts 23:35
%
Five days later the high priest Ananias went down to Caesarea with some of the 
elders and a lawyer named Tertullus, and they brought their charges against 
Paul before the governor.
	--Acts 24:1
%
	--Acts 24:2
%
Everywhere and in every way, most excellent Felix, we acknowledge this with 
profound gratitude.
	--Acts 24:3
%
But in order not to weary you further, I would request that you be kind enough 
to hear us briefly.
	--Acts 24:4
%
“We have found this man to be a troublemaker, stirring up riots among the 
Jews all over the world. He is a ringleader of the Nazarene sect
	--Acts 24:5
%
and even tried to desecrate the temple; so we seized him.
	--Acts 24:6
%

	--Acts 24:7
%
By examining him yourself you will be able to learn the truth about all these 
charges we are bringing against him.”
	--Acts 24:8
%
The other Jews joined in the accusation, asserting that these things were true.
	--Acts 24:9
%
When the governor motioned for him to speak, Paul replied: “I know that for a 
number of years you have been a judge over this nation; so I gladly make my 
defense.
	--Acts 24:10
%
You can easily verify that no more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem 
to worship.
	--Acts 24:11
%
My accusers did not find me arguing with anyone at the temple, or stirring up a 
crowd in the synagogues or anywhere else in the city.
	--Acts 24:12
%
And they cannot prove to you the charges they are now making against me.
	--Acts 24:13
%
However, I admit that I worship the God of our ancestors as a follower of the 
Way, which they call a sect. I believe everything that is in accordance with 
the Law and that is written in the Prophets,
	--Acts 24:14
%
and I have the same hope in God as these men themselves have, that there will 
be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked.
	--Acts 24:15
%
So I strive always to keep my conscience clear before God and man.
	--Acts 24:16
%
“After an absence of several years, I came to Jerusalem to bring my people 
gifts for the poor and to present offerings.
	--Acts 24:17
%
I was ceremonially clean when they found me in the temple courts doing this. 
There was no crowd with me, nor was I involved in any disturbance.
	--Acts 24:18
%
But there are some Jews from the province of Asia, who ought to be here before 
you and bring charges if they have anything against me.
	--Acts 24:19
%
Or these who are here should state what crime they found in me when I stood 
before the Sanhedrin—
	--Acts 24:20
%
unless it was this one thing I shouted as I stood in their presence: ‘It is 
concerning the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you 
today.’”
	--Acts 24:21
%
Then Felix, who was well acquainted with the Way, adjourned the proceedings. 
“When Lysias the commander comes,” he said, “I will decide your case.”
	--Acts 24:22
%
He ordered the centurion to keep Paul under guard but to give him some freedom 
and permit his friends to take care of his needs.
	--Acts 24:23
%
Several days later Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish. He sent 
for Paul and listened to him as he spoke about faith in Christ Jesus.
	--Acts 24:24
%
As Paul talked about righteousness, self-control and the judgment to come, 
Felix was afraid and said, “That’s enough for now! You may leave. When I 
find it convenient, I will send for you.”
	--Acts 24:25
%
At the same time he was hoping that Paul would offer him a bribe, so he sent 
for him frequently and talked with him.
	--Acts 24:26
%
When two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, but because 
Felix wanted to grant a favor to the Jews, he left Paul in prison.
	--Acts 24:27
%
Three days after arriving in the province, Festus went up from Caesarea to 
Jerusalem,
	--Acts 25:1
%
where the chief priests and the Jewish leaders appeared before him and 
presented the charges against Paul.
	--Acts 25:2
%
They requested Festus, as a favor to them, to have Paul transferred to 
Jerusalem, for they were preparing an ambush to kill him along the way.
	--Acts 25:3
%
Festus answered, “Paul is being held at Caesarea, and I myself am going there 
soon.
	--Acts 25:4
%
Let some of your leaders come with me, and if the man has done anything wrong, 
they can press charges against him there.”
	--Acts 25:5
%
After spending eight or ten days with them, Festus went down to Caesarea. The 
next day he convened the court and ordered that Paul be brought before him.
	--Acts 25:6
%
When Paul came in, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him. 
They brought many serious charges against him, but they could not prove them.
	--Acts 25:7
%
Then Paul made his defense: “I have done nothing wrong against the Jewish law 
or against the temple or against Caesar.”
	--Acts 25:8
%
Festus, wishing to do the Jews a favor, said to Paul, “Are you willing to go 
up to Jerusalem and stand trial before me there on these charges?”
	--Acts 25:9
%
Paul answered: “I am now standing before Caesar’s court, where I ought to 
be tried. I have not done any wrong to the Jews, as you yourself know very well.
	--Acts 25:10
%
If, however, I am guilty of doing anything deserving death, I do not refuse to 
die. But if the charges brought against me by these Jews are not true, no one 
has the right to hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar!”
	--Acts 25:11
%
After Festus had conferred with his council, he declared: “You have appealed 
to Caesar. To Caesar you will go!”
	--Acts 25:12
%
A few days later King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea to pay their 
respects to Festus.
	--Acts 25:13
%
Since they were spending many days there, Festus discussed Paul’s case with 
the king. He said: “There is a man here whom Felix left as a prisoner.
	--Acts 25:14
%
When I went to Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews brought 
charges against him and asked that he be condemned.
	--Acts 25:15
%
“I told them that it is not the Roman custom to hand over anyone before they 
have faced their accusers and have had an opportunity to defend themselves 
against the charges.
	--Acts 25:16
%
When they came here with me, I did not delay the case, but convened the court 
the next day and ordered the man to be brought in.
	--Acts 25:17
%
When his accusers got up to speak, they did not charge him with any of the 
crimes I had expected.
	--Acts 25:18
%
Instead, they had some points of dispute with him about their own religion and 
about a dead man named Jesus who Paul claimed was alive.
	--Acts 25:19
%
I was at a loss how to investigate such matters; so I asked if he would be 
willing to go to Jerusalem and stand trial there on these charges.
	--Acts 25:20
%
But when Paul made his appeal to be held over for the Emperor’s decision, I 
ordered him held until I could send him to Caesar.”
	--Acts 25:21
%
Then Agrippa said to Festus, “I would like to hear this man myself.” He 
replied, “Tomorrow you will hear him.”
	--Acts 25:22
%
The next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp and entered the audience 
room with the high-ranking military officers and the prominent men of the city. 
At the command of Festus, Paul was brought in.
	--Acts 25:23
%
Festus said: “King Agrippa, and all who are present with us, you see this 
man! The whole Jewish community has petitioned me about him in Jerusalem and 
here in Caesarea, shouting that he ought not to live any longer.
	--Acts 25:24
%
I found he had done nothing deserving of death, but because he made his appeal 
to the Emperor I decided to send him to Rome.
	--Acts 25:25
%
But I have nothing definite to write to His Majesty about him. Therefore I have 
brought him before all of you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that 
as a result of this investigation I may have something to write.
	--Acts 25:26
%
For I think it is unreasonable to send a prisoner on to Rome without specifying 
the charges against him.”
	--Acts 25:27
%
Then Agrippa said to Paul, “You have permission to speak for yourself.” So 
Paul motioned with his hand and began his defense:
	--Acts 26:1
%
“King Agrippa, I consider myself fortunate to stand before you today as I 
make my defense against all the accusations of the Jews,
	--Acts 26:2
%
and especially so because you are well acquainted with all the Jewish customs 
and controversies. Therefore, I beg you to listen to me patiently.
	--Acts 26:3
%
“The Jewish people all know the way I have lived ever since I was a child, 
from the beginning of my life in my own country, and also in Jerusalem.
	--Acts 26:4
%
They have known me for a long time and can testify, if they are willing, that I 
conformed to the strictest sect of our religion, living as a Pharisee.
	--Acts 26:5
%
And now it is because of my hope in what God has promised our ancestors that I 
am on trial today.
	--Acts 26:6
%
This is the promise our twelve tribes are hoping to see fulfilled as they 
earnestly serve God day and night. King Agrippa, it is because of this hope 
that these Jews are accusing me.
	--Acts 26:7
%
Why should any of you consider it incredible that God raises the dead?
	--Acts 26:8
%
“I too was convinced that I ought to do all that was possible to oppose the 
name of Jesus of Nazareth.
	--Acts 26:9
%
And that is just what I did in Jerusalem. On the authority of the chief priests 
I put many of the Lord’s people in prison, and when they were put to death, I 
cast my vote against them.
	--Acts 26:10
%
Many a time I went from one synagogue to another to have them punished, and I 
tried to force them to blaspheme. I was so obsessed with persecuting them that 
I even hunted them down in foreign cities.
	--Acts 26:11
%
“On one of these journeys I was going to Damascus with the authority and 
commission of the chief priests.
	--Acts 26:12
%
About noon, King Agrippa, as I was on the road, I saw a light from heaven, 
brighter than the sun, blazing around me and my companions.
	--Acts 26:13
%
We all fell to the ground, and I heard a voice saying to me in Aramaic, 
‘Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you to kick against the 
goads.’
	--Acts 26:14
%
“Then I asked, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ “ ‘I am Jesus, whom you are 
persecuting,’ the Lord replied.
	--Acts 26:15
%
‘Now get up and stand on your feet. I have appeared to you to appoint you as 
a servant and as a witness of what you have seen and will see of me.
	--Acts 26:16
%
I will rescue you from your own people and from the Gentiles. I am sending you 
to them
	--Acts 26:17
%
to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of 
Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among 
those who are sanctified by faith in me.’
	--Acts 26:18
%
“So then, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the vision from heaven.
	--Acts 26:19
%
First to those in Damascus, then to those in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and 
then to the Gentiles, I preached that they should repent and turn to God and 
demonstrate their repentance by their deeds.
	--Acts 26:20
%
That is why some Jews seized me in the temple courts and tried to kill me.
	--Acts 26:21
%
But God has helped me to this very day; so I stand here and testify to small 
and great alike. I am saying nothing beyond what the prophets and Moses said 
would happen—
	--Acts 26:22
%
that the Messiah would suffer and, as the first to rise from the dead, would 
bring the message of light to his own people and to the Gentiles.”
	--Acts 26:23
%
At this point Festus interrupted Paul’s defense. “You are out of your mind, 
Paul!” he shouted. “Your great learning is driving you insane.”
	--Acts 26:24
%
“I am not insane, most excellent Festus,” Paul replied. “What I am saying 
is true and reasonable.
	--Acts 26:25
%
The king is familiar with these things, and I can speak freely to him. I am 
convinced that none of this has escaped his notice, because it was not done in 
a corner.
	--Acts 26:26
%
King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know you do.”
	--Acts 26:27
%
Then Agrippa said to Paul, “Do you think that in such a short time you can 
persuade me to be a Christian?”
	--Acts 26:28
%
Paul replied, “Short time or long—I pray to God that not only you but all 
who are listening to me today may become what I am, except for these chains.”
	--Acts 26:29
%
The king rose, and with him the governor and Bernice and those sitting with 
them.
	--Acts 26:30
%
After they left the room, they began saying to one another, “This man is not 
doing anything that deserves death or imprisonment.”
	--Acts 26:31
%
Agrippa said to Festus, “This man could have been set free if he had not 
appealed to Caesar.”
	--Acts 26:32
%
When it was decided that we would sail for Italy, Paul and some other prisoners 
were handed over to a centurion named Julius, who belonged to the Imperial 
Regiment.
	--Acts 27:1
%
We boarded a ship from Adramyttium about to sail for ports along the coast of 
the province of Asia, and we put out to sea. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from 
Thessalonica, was with us.
	--Acts 27:2
%
The next day we landed at Sidon; and Julius, in kindness to Paul, allowed him 
to go to his friends so they might provide for his needs.
	--Acts 27:3
%
From there we put out to sea again and passed to the lee of Cyprus because the 
winds were against us.
	--Acts 27:4
%
When we had sailed across the open sea off the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, 
we landed at Myra in Lycia.
	--Acts 27:5
%
There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy and put us on 
board.
	--Acts 27:6
%
We made slow headway for many days and had difficulty arriving off Cnidus. When 
the wind did not allow us to hold our course, we sailed to the lee of Crete, 
opposite Salmone.
	--Acts 27:7
%
We moved along the coast with difficulty and came to a place called Fair 
Havens, near the town of Lasea.
	--Acts 27:8
%
Much time had been lost, and sailing had already become dangerous because by 
now it was after the Day of Atonement. So Paul warned them,
	--Acts 27:9
%
“Men, I can see that our voyage is going to be disastrous and bring great 
loss to ship and cargo, and to our own lives also.”
	--Acts 27:10
%
But the centurion, instead of listening to what Paul said, followed the advice 
of the pilot and of the owner of the ship.
	--Acts 27:11
%
Since the harbor was unsuitable to winter in, the majority decided that we 
should sail on, hoping to reach Phoenix and winter there. This was a harbor in 
Crete, facing both southwest and northwest.
	--Acts 27:12
%
When a gentle south wind began to blow, they saw their opportunity; so they 
weighed anchor and sailed along the shore of Crete.
	--Acts 27:13
%
Before very long, a wind of hurricane force, called the Northeaster, swept down 
from the island.
	--Acts 27:14
%
The ship was caught by the storm and could not head into the wind; so we gave 
way to it and were driven along.
	--Acts 27:15
%
As we passed to the lee of a small island called Cauda, we were hardly able to 
make the lifeboat secure,
	--Acts 27:16
%
so the men hoisted it aboard. Then they passed ropes under the ship itself to 
hold it together. Because they were afraid they would run aground on the 
sandbars of Syrtis, they lowered the sea anchor and let the ship be driven 
along.
	--Acts 27:17
%
We took such a violent battering from the storm that the next day they began to 
throw the cargo overboard.
	--Acts 27:18
%
On the third day, they threw the ship’s tackle overboard with their own hands.
	--Acts 27:19
%
When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and the storm continued 
raging, we finally gave up all hope of being saved.
	--Acts 27:20
%
After they had gone a long time without food, Paul stood up before them and 
said: “Men, you should have taken my advice not to sail from Crete; then you 
would have spared yourselves this damage and loss.
	--Acts 27:21
%
But now I urge you to keep up your courage, because not one of you will be 
lost; only the ship will be destroyed.
	--Acts 27:22
%
Last night an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I serve stood beside me
	--Acts 27:23
%
and said, ‘Do not be afraid, Paul. You must stand trial before Caesar; and 
God has graciously given you the lives of all who sail with you.’
	--Acts 27:24
%
So keep up your courage, men, for I have faith in God that it will happen just 
as he told me.
	--Acts 27:25
%
Nevertheless, we must run aground on some island.”
	--Acts 27:26
%
On the fourteenth night we were still being driven across the Adriatic Sea, 
when about midnight the sailors sensed they were approaching land.
	--Acts 27:27
%
They took soundings and found that the water was a hundred and twenty feet 
deep. A short time later they took soundings again and found it was ninety feet 
deep.
	--Acts 27:28
%
Fearing that we would be dashed against the rocks, they dropped four anchors 
from the stern and prayed for daylight.
	--Acts 27:29
%
In an attempt to escape from the ship, the sailors let the lifeboat down into 
the sea, pretending they were going to lower some anchors from the bow.
	--Acts 27:30
%
Then Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, “Unless these men stay with 
the ship, you cannot be saved.”
	--Acts 27:31
%
So the soldiers cut the ropes that held the lifeboat and let it drift away.
	--Acts 27:32
%
Just before dawn Paul urged them all to eat. “For the last fourteen days,” 
he said, “you have been in constant suspense and have gone without food—you 
haven’t eaten anything.
	--Acts 27:33
%
Now I urge you to take some food. You need it to survive. Not one of you will 
lose a single hair from his head.”
	--Acts 27:34
%
After he said this, he took some bread and gave thanks to God in front of them 
all. Then he broke it and began to eat.
	--Acts 27:35
%
They were all encouraged and ate some food themselves.
	--Acts 27:36
%
Altogether there were 276 of us on board.
	--Acts 27:37
%
When they had eaten as much as they wanted, they lightened the ship by throwing 
the grain into the sea.
	--Acts 27:38
%
When daylight came, they did not recognize the land, but they saw a bay with a 
sandy beach, where they decided to run the ship aground if they could.
	--Acts 27:39
%
Cutting loose the anchors, they left them in the sea and at the same time 
untied the ropes that held the rudders. Then they hoisted the foresail to the 
wind and made for the beach.
	--Acts 27:40
%
But the ship struck a sandbar and ran aground. The bow stuck fast and would not 
move, and the stern was broken to pieces by the pounding of the surf.
	--Acts 27:41
%
The soldiers planned to kill the prisoners to prevent any of them from swimming 
away and escaping.
	--Acts 27:42
%
But the centurion wanted to spare Paul’s life and kept them from carrying out 
their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to 
land.
	--Acts 27:43
%
The rest were to get there on planks or on other pieces of the ship. In this 
way everyone reached land safely.
	--Acts 27:44
%
Once safely on shore, we found out that the island was called Malta.
	--Acts 28:1
%
The islanders showed us unusual kindness. They built a fire and welcomed us all 
because it was raining and cold.
	--Acts 28:2
%
Paul gathered a pile of brushwood and, as he put it on the fire, a viper, 
driven out by the heat, fastened itself on his hand.
	--Acts 28:3
%
When the islanders saw the snake hanging from his hand, they said to each 
other, “This man must be a murderer; for though he escaped from the sea, the 
goddess Justice has not allowed him to live.”
	--Acts 28:4
%
But Paul shook the snake off into the fire and suffered no ill effects.
	--Acts 28:5
%
The people expected him to swell up or suddenly fall dead; but after waiting a 
long time and seeing nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds 
and said he was a god.
	--Acts 28:6
%
There was an estate nearby that belonged to Publius, the chief official of the 
island. He welcomed us to his home and showed us generous hospitality for three 
days.
	--Acts 28:7
%
His father was sick in bed, suffering from fever and dysentery. Paul went in to 
see him and, after prayer, placed his hands on him and healed him.
	--Acts 28:8
%
When this had happened, the rest of the sick on the island came and were cured.
	--Acts 28:9
%
They honored us in many ways; and when we were ready to sail, they furnished us 
with the supplies we needed.
	--Acts 28:10
%
After three months we put out to sea in a ship that had wintered in the 
island—it was an Alexandrian ship with the figurehead of the twin gods Castor 
and Pollux.
	--Acts 28:11
%
We put in at Syracuse and stayed there three days.
	--Acts 28:12
%
From there we set sail and arrived at Rhegium. The next day the south wind came 
up, and on the following day we reached Puteoli.
	--Acts 28:13
%
There we found some brothers and sisters who invited us to spend a week with 
them. And so we came to Rome.
	--Acts 28:14
%
The brothers and sisters there had heard that we were coming, and they traveled 
as far as the Forum of Appius and the Three Taverns to meet us. At the sight of 
these people Paul thanked God and was encouraged.
	--Acts 28:15
%
When we got to Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself, with a soldier to 
guard him.
	--Acts 28:16
%
Three days later he called together the local Jewish leaders. When they had 
assembled, Paul said to them: “My brothers, although I have done nothing 
against our people or against the customs of our ancestors, I was arrested in 
Jerusalem and handed over to the Romans.
	--Acts 28:17
%
They examined me and wanted to release me, because I was not guilty of any 
crime deserving death.
	--Acts 28:18
%
The Jews objected, so I was compelled to make an appeal to Caesar. I certainly 
did not intend to bring any charge against my own people.
	--Acts 28:19
%
For this reason I have asked to see you and talk with you. It is because of the 
hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain.”
	--Acts 28:20
%
They replied, “We have not received any letters from Judea concerning you, 
and none of our people who have come from there has reported or said anything 
bad about you.
	--Acts 28:21
%
But we want to hear what your views are, for we know that people everywhere are 
talking against this sect.”
	--Acts 28:22
%
They arranged to meet Paul on a certain day, and came in even larger numbers to 
the place where he was staying. He witnessed to them from morning till evening, 
explaining about the kingdom of God, and from the Law of Moses and from the 
Prophets he tried to persuade them about Jesus.
	--Acts 28:23
%
Some were convinced by what he said, but others would not believe.
	--Acts 28:24
%
They disagreed among themselves and began to leave after Paul had made this 
final statement: “The Holy Spirit spoke the truth to your ancestors when he 
said through Isaiah the prophet:
	--Acts 28:25
%
“‘Go to this people and say, “You will be ever hearing but never 
understanding; you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.”
	--Acts 28:26
%
For this people’s heart has become calloused; they hardly hear with their 
ears, and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their 
eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts and turn, and I would 
heal them.’
	--Acts 28:27
%
“Therefore I want you to know that God’s salvation has been sent to the 
Gentiles, and they will listen!”
	--Acts 28:28
%

	--Acts 28:29
%
For two whole years Paul stayed there in his own rented house and welcomed all 
who came to see him.
	--Acts 28:30
%
He proclaimed the kingdom of God and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ—with 
all boldness and without hindrance!
	--Acts 28:31
%
Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,
	 --Colossians 1:1
%
To God’s holy people in Colossae, the faithful brothers and sisters in 
Christ: Grace and peace to you from God our Father.
	 --Colossians 1:2
%
We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you,
	 --Colossians 1:3
%
because we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love you have 
for all God’s people—
	 --Colossians 1:4
%
the faith and love that spring from the hope stored up for you in heaven and 
about which you have already heard in the true message of the gospel
	 --Colossians 1:5
%
that has come to you. In the same way, the gospel is bearing fruit and growing 
throughout the whole world—just as it has been doing among you since the day 
you heard it and truly understood God’s grace.
	 --Colossians 1:6
%
You learned it from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant, who is a faithful 
minister of Christ on our behalf,
	 --Colossians 1:7
%
and who also told us of your love in the Spirit.
	 --Colossians 1:8
%
For this reason, since the day we heard about you, we have not stopped praying 
for you. We continually ask God to fill you with the knowledge of his will 
through all the wisdom and understanding that the Spirit gives,
	 --Colossians 1:9
%
so that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and please him in every way: 
bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God,
	 --Colossians 1:10
%
being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you 
may have great endurance and patience,
	 --Colossians 1:11
%
and giving joyful thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the 
inheritance of his holy people in the kingdom of light.
	 --Colossians 1:12
%
For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the 
kingdom of the Son he loves,
	 --Colossians 1:13
%
in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.
	 --Colossians 1:14
%
The Son is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation.
	 --Colossians 1:15
%
For in him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and 
invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things have 
been created through him and for him.
	 --Colossians 1:16
%
He is before all things, and in him all things hold together.
	 --Colossians 1:17
%
And he is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning and the 
firstborn from among the dead, so that in everything he might have the 
supremacy.
	 --Colossians 1:18
%
For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him,
	 --Colossians 1:19
%
and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or 
things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross.
	 --Colossians 1:20
%
Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of your 
evil behavior.
	 --Colossians 1:21
%
But now he has reconciled you by Christ’s physical body through death to 
present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation—
	 --Colossians 1:22
%
if you continue in your faith, established and firm, and do not move from the 
hope held out in the gospel. This is the gospel that you heard and that has 
been proclaimed to every creature under heaven, and of which I, Paul, have 
become a servant.
	 --Colossians 1:23
%
Now I rejoice in what I am suffering for you, and I fill up in my flesh what is 
still lacking in regard to Christ’s afflictions, for the sake of his body, 
which is the church.
	 --Colossians 1:24
%
I have become its servant by the commission God gave me to present to you the 
word of God in its fullness—
	 --Colossians 1:25
%
the mystery that has been kept hidden for ages and generations, but is now 
disclosed to the Lord’s people.
	 --Colossians 1:26
%
To them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of 
this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.
	 --Colossians 1:27
%
He is the one we proclaim, admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom, 
so that we may present everyone fully mature in Christ.
	 --Colossians 1:28
%
To this end I strenuously contend with all the energy Christ so powerfully 
works in me.
	 --Colossians 1:29
%
I want you to know how hard I am contending for you and for those at Laodicea, 
and for all who have not met me personally.
	 --Colossians 2:1
%
My goal is that they may be encouraged in heart and united in love, so that 
they may have the full riches of complete understanding, in order that they may 
know the mystery of God, namely, Christ,
	 --Colossians 2:2
%
in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
	 --Colossians 2:3
%
I tell you this so that no one may deceive you by fine-sounding arguments.
	 --Colossians 2:4
%
For though I am absent from you in body, I am present with you in spirit and 
delight to see how disciplined you are and how firm your faith in Christ is.
	 --Colossians 2:5
%
So then, just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live your lives 
in him,
	 --Colossians 2:6
%
rooted and built up in him, strengthened in the faith as you were taught, and 
overflowing with thankfulness.
	 --Colossians 2:7
%
See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive 
philosophy, which depends on human tradition and the elemental spiritual forces 
of this world rather than on Christ.
	 --Colossians 2:8
%
For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form,
	 --Colossians 2:9
%
and in Christ you have been brought to fullness. He is the head over every 
power and authority.
	 --Colossians 2:10
%
In him you were also circumcised with a circumcision not performed by human 
hands. Your whole self ruled by the flesh was put off when you were circumcised 
by Christ,
	 --Colossians 2:11
%
having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him 
through your faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead.
	 --Colossians 2:12
%
When you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, God 
made you alive with Christ. He forgave us all our sins,
	 --Colossians 2:13
%
having canceled the charge of our legal indebtedness, which stood against us 
and condemned us; he has taken it away, nailing it to the cross.
	 --Colossians 2:14
%
And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of 
them, triumphing over them by the cross.
	 --Colossians 2:15
%
Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard 
to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration or a Sabbath day.
	 --Colossians 2:16
%
These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is 
found in Christ.
	 --Colossians 2:17
%
Do not let anyone who delights in false humility and the worship of angels 
disqualify you. Such a person also goes into great detail about what they have 
seen; they are puffed up with idle notions by their unspiritual mind.
	 --Colossians 2:18
%
They have lost connection with the head, from whom the whole body, supported 
and held together by its ligaments and sinews, grows as God causes it to grow.
	 --Colossians 2:19
%
Since you died with Christ to the elemental spiritual forces of this world, 
why, as though you still belonged to the world, do you submit to its rules:
	 --Colossians 2:20
%
“Do not handle! Do not taste! Do not touch!”?
	 --Colossians 2:21
%
These rules, which have to do with things that are all destined to perish with 
use, are based on merely human commands and teachings.
	 --Colossians 2:22
%
Such regulations indeed have an appearance of wisdom, with their self-imposed 
worship, their false humility and their harsh treatment of the body, but they 
lack any value in restraining sensual indulgence.
	 --Colossians 2:23
%
Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, 
where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.
	 --Colossians 3:1
%
Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things.
	 --Colossians 3:2
%
For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God.
	 --Colossians 3:3
%
When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will appear with him in 
glory.
	 --Colossians 3:4
%
Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual 
immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed, which is idolatry.
	 --Colossians 3:5
%
Because of these, the wrath of God is coming.
	 --Colossians 3:6
%
You used to walk in these ways, in the life you once lived.
	 --Colossians 3:7
%
But now you must also rid yourselves of all such things as these: anger, rage, 
malice, slander, and filthy language from your lips.
	 --Colossians 3:8
%
Do not lie to each other, since you have taken off your old self with its 
practices
	 --Colossians 3:9
%
and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image 
of its Creator.
	 --Colossians 3:10
%
Here there is no Gentile or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, 
Scythian, slave or free, but Christ is all, and is in all.
	 --Colossians 3:11
%
Therefore, as God’s chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves 
with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience.
	 --Colossians 3:12
%
Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance 
against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you.
	 --Colossians 3:13
%
And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in 
perfect unity.
	 --Colossians 3:14
%
Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you 
were called to peace. And be thankful.
	 --Colossians 3:15
%
Let the message of Christ dwell among you richly as you teach and admonish one 
another with all wisdom through psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit, 
singing to God with gratitude in your hearts.
	 --Colossians 3:16
%
And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord 
Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.
	 --Colossians 3:17
%
Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.
	 --Colossians 3:18
%
Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them.
	 --Colossians 3:19
%
Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord.
	 --Colossians 3:20
%
Fathers, do not embitter your children, or they will become discouraged.
	 --Colossians 3:21
%
Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything; and do it, not only when their 
eye is on you and to curry their favor, but with sincerity of heart and 
reverence for the Lord.
	 --Colossians 3:22
%
Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not 
for human masters,
	 --Colossians 3:23
%
since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. 
It is the Lord Christ you are serving.
	 --Colossians 3:24
%
Anyone who does wrong will be repaid for their wrongs, and there is no 
favoritism.
	 --Colossians 3:25
%
Masters, provide your slaves with what is right and fair, because you know that 
you also have a Master in heaven.
	 --Colossians 4:1
%
Devote yourselves to prayer, being watchful and thankful.
	 --Colossians 4:2
%
And pray for us, too, that God may open a door for our message, so that we may 
proclaim the mystery of Christ, for which I am in chains.
	 --Colossians 4:3
%
Pray that I may proclaim it clearly, as I should.
	 --Colossians 4:4
%
Be wise in the way you act toward outsiders; make the most of every opportunity.
	 --Colossians 4:5
%
Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you 
may know how to answer everyone.
	 --Colossians 4:6
%
Tychicus will tell you all the news about me. He is a dear brother, a faithful 
minister and fellow servant in the Lord.
	 --Colossians 4:7
%
I am sending him to you for the express purpose that you may know about our 
circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts.
	 --Colossians 4:8
%
He is coming with Onesimus, our faithful and dear brother, who is one of you. 
They will tell you everything that is happening here.
	 --Colossians 4:9
%
My fellow prisoner Aristarchus sends you his greetings, as does Mark, the 
cousin of Barnabas. (You have received instructions about him; if he comes to 
you, welcome him.)
	 --Colossians 4:10
%
Jesus, who is called Justus, also sends greetings. These are the only Jews 
among my co-workers for the kingdom of God, and they have proved a comfort to 
me.
	 --Colossians 4:11
%
Epaphras, who is one of you and a servant of Christ Jesus, sends greetings. He 
is always wrestling in prayer for you, that you may stand firm in all the will 
of God, mature and fully assured.
	 --Colossians 4:12
%
I vouch for him that he is working hard for you and for those at Laodicea and 
Hierapolis.
	 --Colossians 4:13
%
Our dear friend Luke, the doctor, and Demas send greetings.
	 --Colossians 4:14
%
Give my greetings to the brothers and sisters at Laodicea, and to Nympha and 
the church in her house.
	 --Colossians 4:15
%
After this letter has been read to you, see that it is also read in the church 
of the Laodiceans and that you in turn read the letter from Laodicea.
	 --Colossians 4:16
%
Tell Archippus: “See to it that you complete the ministry you have received 
in the Lord.”
	 --Colossians 4:17

I, Paul, write this greeting in my own hand. Remember my chains. Grace be with 
you.
	 --Colossians 4:18
%Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, To God’s holy people in 
Ephesus, the faithful in Christ Jesus:
	 --Ephesians 1:1
%
Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
	 --Ephesians 1:2
%
Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in 
the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ.
	 --Ephesians 1:3
%
For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and 
blameless in his sight. In love
	 --Ephesians 1:4
%
he predestined us for adoption to sonship through Jesus Christ, in accordance 
with his pleasure and will—
	 --Ephesians 1:5
%
to the praise of his glorious grace, which he has freely given us in the One he 
loves.
	 --Ephesians 1:6
%
In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in 
accordance with the riches of God’s grace
	 --Ephesians 1:7
%
that he lavished on us. With all wisdom and understanding,
	 --Ephesians 1:8
%
he made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure, 
which he purposed in Christ,
	 --Ephesians 1:9
%
to be put into effect when the times reach their fulfillment—to bring unity 
to all things in heaven and on earth under Christ.
	 --Ephesians 1:10
%
In him we were also chosen, having been predestined according to the plan of 
him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will,
	 --Ephesians 1:11
%
in order that we, who were the first to put our hope in Christ, might be for 
the praise of his glory.
	 --Ephesians 1:12
%
And you also were included in Christ when you heard the message of truth, the 
gospel of your salvation. When you believed, you were marked in him with a 
seal, the promised Holy Spirit,
	 --Ephesians 1:13
%
who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who 
are God’s possession—to the praise of his glory.
	 --Ephesians 1:14
%
For this reason, ever since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your 
love for all God’s people,
	 --Ephesians 1:15
%
I have not stopped giving thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers.
	 --Ephesians 1:16
%
I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may 
give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that you may know him better.
	 --Ephesians 1:17
%
I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may 
know the hope to which he has called you, the riches of his glorious 
inheritance in his holy people,
	 --Ephesians 1:18
%
and his incomparably great power for us who believe. That power is the same as 
the mighty strength
	 --Ephesians 1:19
%
he exerted when he raised Christ from the dead and seated him at his right hand 
in the heavenly realms,
	 --Ephesians 1:20
%
far above all rule and authority, power and dominion, and every name that is 
invoked, not only in the present age but also in the one to come.
	 --Ephesians 1:21
%
And God placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be head over 
everything for the church,
	 --Ephesians 1:22
%
which is his body, the fullness of him who fills everything in every way.
	 --Ephesians 1:23
%
As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins,
	 --Ephesians 2:1
%
in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the 
ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in those who are 
disobedient.
	 --Ephesians 2:2
%
All of us also lived among them at one time, gratifying the cravings of our 
flesh and following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature 
deserving of wrath.
	 --Ephesians 2:3
%
But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy,
	 --Ephesians 2:4
%
made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by 
grace you have been saved.
	 --Ephesians 2:5
%
And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms 
in Christ Jesus,
	 --Ephesians 2:6
%
in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his 
grace, expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus.
	 --Ephesians 2:7
%
For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from 
yourselves, it is the gift of God—
	 --Ephesians 2:8
%
not by works, so that no one can boast.
	 --Ephesians 2:9
%
For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which 
God prepared in advance for us to do.
	 --Ephesians 2:10
%
Therefore, remember that formerly you who are Gentiles by birth and called 
“uncircumcised” by those who call themselves “the circumcision” (which 
is done in the body by human hands)—
	 --Ephesians 2:11
%
remember that at that time you were separate from Christ, excluded from 
citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise, without 
hope and without God in the world.
	 --Ephesians 2:12
%
But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near by 
the blood of Christ.
	 --Ephesians 2:13
%
For he himself is our peace, who has made the two groups one and has destroyed 
the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility,
	 --Ephesians 2:14
%
by setting aside in his flesh the law with its commands and regulations. His 
purpose was to create in himself one new humanity out of the two, thus making 
peace,
	 --Ephesians 2:15
%
and in one body to reconcile both of them to God through the cross, by which he 
put to death their hostility.
	 --Ephesians 2:16
%
He came and preached peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were 
near.
	 --Ephesians 2:17
%
For through him we both have access to the Father by one Spirit.
	 --Ephesians 2:18
%
Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens 
with God’s people and also members of his household,
	 --Ephesians 2:19
%
built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself 
as the chief cornerstone.
	 --Ephesians 2:20
%
In him the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple 
in the Lord.
	 --Ephesians 2:21
%
And in him you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God 
lives by his Spirit.
	 --Ephesians 2:22
%
For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you 
Gentiles—
	 --Ephesians 3:1
%
Surely you have heard about the administration of God’s grace that was given 
to me for you,
	 --Ephesians 3:2
%
that is, the mystery made known to me by revelation, as I have already written 
briefly.
	 --Ephesians 3:3
%
In reading this, then, you will be able to understand my insight into the 
mystery of Christ,
	 --Ephesians 3:4
%
which was not made known to people in other generations as it has now been 
revealed by the Spirit to God’s holy apostles and prophets.
	 --Ephesians 3:5
%
This mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are heirs together with 
Israel, members together of one body, and sharers together in the promise in 
Christ Jesus.
	 --Ephesians 3:6
%
I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God’s grace given me through 
the working of his power.
	 --Ephesians 3:7
%
Although I am less than the least of all the Lord’s people, this grace was 
given me: to preach to the Gentiles the boundless riches of Christ,
	 --Ephesians 3:8
%
and to make plain to everyone the administration of this mystery, which for 
ages past was kept hidden in God, who created all things.
	 --Ephesians 3:9
%
His intent was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should 
be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms,
	 --Ephesians 3:10
%
according to his eternal purpose that he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord.
	 --Ephesians 3:11
%
In him and through faith in him we may approach God with freedom and confidence.
	 --Ephesians 3:12
%
I ask you, therefore, not to be discouraged because of my sufferings for you, 
which are your glory.
	 --Ephesians 3:13
%
For this reason I kneel before the Father,
	 --Ephesians 3:14
%
from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name.
	 --Ephesians 3:15
%
I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through 
his Spirit in your inner being,
	 --Ephesians 3:16
%
so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you, 
being rooted and established in love,
	 --Ephesians 3:17
%
may have power, together with all the Lord’s holy people, to grasp how wide 
and long and high and deep is the love of Christ,
	 --Ephesians 3:18
%
and to know this love that surpasses knowledge—that you may be filled to the 
measure of all the fullness of God.
	 --Ephesians 3:19
%
Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, 
according to his power that is at work within us,
	 --Ephesians 3:20
%
to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, 
for ever and ever! Amen.
	 --Ephesians 3:21
%
As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you to live a life worthy of the 
calling you have received.
	 --Ephesians 4:1
%
Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love.
	 --Ephesians 4:2
%
Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.
	 --Ephesians 4:3
%
There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to one hope when you 
were called;
	 --Ephesians 4:4
%
one Lord, one faith, one baptism;
	 --Ephesians 4:5
%
one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.
	 --Ephesians 4:6
%
But to each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it.
	 --Ephesians 4:7
%
This is why it says: “When he ascended on high, he took many captives and 
gave gifts to his people.”
	 --Ephesians 4:8
%
(What does “he ascended” mean except that he also descended to the lower, 
earthly regions?
	 --Ephesians 4:9
%
He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens, in 
order to fill the whole universe.)
	 --Ephesians 4:10
%
So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors 
and teachers,
	 --Ephesians 4:11
%
to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be 
built up
	 --Ephesians 4:12
%
until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God 
and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.
	 --Ephesians 4:13
%
Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and 
blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and 
craftiness of people in their deceitful scheming.
	 --Ephesians 4:14
%
Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will grow to become in every respect 
the mature body of him who is the head, that is, Christ.
	 --Ephesians 4:15
%
From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, 
grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.
	 --Ephesians 4:16
%
So I tell you this, and insist on it in the Lord, that you must no longer live 
as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their thinking.
	 --Ephesians 4:17
%
They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God 
because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts.
	 --Ephesians 4:18
%
Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality so 
as to indulge in every kind of impurity, and they are full of greed.
	 --Ephesians 4:19
%
That, however, is not the way of life you learned
	 --Ephesians 4:20
%
when you heard about Christ and were taught in him in accordance with the truth 
that is in Jesus.
	 --Ephesians 4:21
%
You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old 
self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires;
	 --Ephesians 4:22
%
to be made new in the attitude of your minds;
	 --Ephesians 4:23
%
and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and 
holiness.
	 --Ephesians 4:24
%
Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to your 
neighbor, for we are all members of one body.
	 --Ephesians 4:25
%
“In your anger do not sin”: Do not let the sun go down while you are still 
angry,
	 --Ephesians 4:26
%
and do not give the devil a foothold.
	 --Ephesians 4:27
%
Anyone who has been stealing must steal no longer, but must work, doing 
something useful with their own hands, that they may have something to share 
with those in need.
	 --Ephesians 4:28
%
Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is 
helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit 
those who listen.
	 --Ephesians 4:29
%
And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day 
of redemption.
	 --Ephesians 4:30
%
Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with 
every form of malice.
	 --Ephesians 4:31
%
Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in 
Christ God forgave you.
	 --Ephesians 4:32
%
5 Follow God’s example, therefore, as dearly loved children
	 --Ephesians 5:1
%
and walk in the way of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us 
as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.
	 --Ephesians 5:2
%
But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any 
kind of impurity, or of greed, because these are improper for God’s holy 
people.
	 --Ephesians 5:3
%
Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking, which are out of 
place, but rather thanksgiving.
	 --Ephesians 5:4
%
For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure or greedy person—such a 
person is an idolater—has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
	 --Ephesians 5:5
%
Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things God’s 
wrath comes on those who are disobedient.
	 --Ephesians 5:6
%
Therefore do not be partners with them.
	 --Ephesians 5:7
%
For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children 
of light
	 --Ephesians 5:8
%
(for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness and truth)
	 --Ephesians 5:9
%
and find out what pleases the Lord.
	 --Ephesians 5:10
%
Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.
	 --Ephesians 5:11
%
It is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret.
	 --Ephesians 5:12
%
But everything exposed by the light becomes visible—and everything that is 
illuminated becomes a light.
	 --Ephesians 5:13
%
This is why it is said: “Wake up, sleeper, rise from the dead, and Christ 
will shine on you.”
	 --Ephesians 5:14
%
Be very careful, then, how you live—not as unwise but as wise,
	 --Ephesians 5:15
%
making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil.
	 --Ephesians 5:16
%
Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord’s will is.
	 --Ephesians 5:17
%
Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with 
the Spirit,
	 --Ephesians 5:18
%
speaking to one another with psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit. Sing and 
make music from your heart to the Lord,
	 --Ephesians 5:19
%
always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord 
Jesus Christ.
	 --Ephesians 5:20
%
Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.
	 --Ephesians 5:21
%
Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord.
	 --Ephesians 5:22
%
For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, 
his body, of which he is the Savior.
	 --Ephesians 5:23
%
Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their 
husbands in everything.
	 --Ephesians 5:24
%
Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up 
for her
	 --Ephesians 5:25
%
to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word,
	 --Ephesians 5:26
%
and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or 
any other blemish, but holy and blameless.
	 --Ephesians 5:27
%
In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He 
who loves his wife loves himself.
	 --Ephesians 5:28
%
After all, no one ever hated their own body, but they feed and care for their 
body, just as Christ does the church—
	 --Ephesians 5:29
%
for we are members of his body.
	 --Ephesians 5:30
%
“For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his 
wife, and the two will become one flesh.”
	 --Ephesians 5:31
%
This is a profound mystery—but I am talking about Christ and the church.
	 --Ephesians 5:32
%
However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the 
wife must respect her husband.
	 --Ephesians 5:33
%
Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.
	 --Ephesians 6:1
%
“Honor your father and mother”—which is the first commandment with a 
promise—
	 --Ephesians 6:2
%
“so that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy long life on the 
earth.”
	 --Ephesians 6:3
%
Fathers, do not exasperate your children; instead, bring them up in the 
training and instruction of the Lord.
	 --Ephesians 6:4
%
Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of 
heart, just as you would obey Christ.
	 --Ephesians 6:5
%
Obey them not only to win their favor when their eye is on you, but as slaves 
of Christ, doing the will of God from your heart.
	 --Ephesians 6:6
%
Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not people,
	 --Ephesians 6:7
%
because you know that the Lord will reward each one for whatever good they do, 
whether they are slave or free.
	 --Ephesians 6:8
%
And masters, treat your slaves in the same way. Do not threaten them, since you 
know that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no 
favoritism with him.
	 --Ephesians 6:9
%
Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power.
	 --Ephesians 6:10
%
Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the 
devil’s schemes.
	 --Ephesians 6:11
%
For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, 
against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the 
spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.
	 --Ephesians 6:12
%
Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you 
may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand.
	 --Ephesians 6:13
%
Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the 
breastplate of righteousness in place,
	 --Ephesians 6:14
%
and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of 
peace.
	 --Ephesians 6:15
%
In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can 
extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.
	 --Ephesians 6:16
%
Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of 
God.
	 --Ephesians 6:17
%
And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. 
With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord’s 
people.
	 --Ephesians 6:18
%
Pray also for me, that whenever I speak, words may be given me so that I will 
fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel,
	 --Ephesians 6:19
%
for which I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may declare it fearlessly, 
as I should.
	 --Ephesians 6:20
%
Tychicus, the dear brother and faithful servant in the Lord, will tell you 
everything, so that you also may know how I am and what I am doing.
	 --Ephesians 6:21
%
I am sending him to you for this very purpose, that you may know how we are, 
and that he may encourage you.
	 --Ephesians 6:22
%
Peace to the brothers and sisters, and love with faith from God the Father and 
the Lord Jesus Christ.
	 --Ephesians 6:23
%
Grace to all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with an undying love.
	 --Ephesians 6:24
%
Paul, an apostle—sent not from men nor by a man, but by Jesus Christ and God 
the Father, who raised him from the dead—
	--Galatians 1:1
%
and all the brothers and sisters with me, To the churches in Galatia:
	--Galatians 1:2
%
Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,
	--Galatians 1:3
%
who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age, according 
to the will of our God and Father,
	--Galatians 1:4
%
to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
	--Galatians 1:5
%
I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you to 
live in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel—
	--Galatians 1:6
%
which is really no gospel at all. Evidently some people are throwing you into 
confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ.
	--Galatians 1:7
%
But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the 
one we preached to you, let them be under God’s curse!
	--Galatians 1:8
%
As we have already said, so now I say again: If anybody is preaching to you a 
gospel other than what you accepted, let them be under God’s curse!
	--Galatians 1:9
%
Am I now trying to win the approval of human beings, or of God? Or am I trying 
to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a 
servant of Christ.
	--Galatians 1:10
%
I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that the gospel I preached is not of 
human origin.
	--Galatians 1:11
%
I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it 
by revelation from Jesus Christ.
	--Galatians 1:12
%
For you have heard of my previous way of life in Judaism, how intensely I 
persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it.
	--Galatians 1:13
%
I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people and was 
extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers.
	--Galatians 1:14
%
But when God, who set me apart from my mother’s womb and called me by his 
grace, was pleased
	--Galatians 1:15
%
to reveal his Son in me so that I might preach him among the Gentiles, my 
immediate response was not to consult any human being.
	--Galatians 1:16
%
I did not go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before I was, but I 
went into Arabia. Later I returned to Damascus.
	--Galatians 1:17
%
Then after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to get acquainted with Cephas 
and stayed with him fifteen days.
	--Galatians 1:18
%
I saw none of the other apostles—only James, the Lord’s brother.
	--Galatians 1:19
%
I assure you before God that what I am writing you is no lie.
	--Galatians 1:20
%
Then I went to Syria and Cilicia.
	--Galatians 1:21
%
I was personally unknown to the churches of Judea that are in Christ.
	--Galatians 1:22
%
They only heard the report: “The man who formerly persecuted us is now 
preaching the faith he once tried to destroy.”
	--Galatians 1:23
%
And they praised God because of me.
	--Galatians 1:24
%
Then after fourteen years, I went up again to Jerusalem, this time with 
Barnabas. I took Titus along also.
	--Galatians 2:1
%
I went in response to a revelation and, meeting privately with those esteemed 
as leaders, I presented to them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles. I 
wanted to be sure I was not running and had not been running my race in vain.
	--Galatians 2:2
%
Yet not even Titus, who was with me, was compelled to be circumcised, even 
though he was a Greek.
	--Galatians 2:3
%
This matter arose because some false believers had infiltrated our ranks to spy 
on the freedom we have in Christ Jesus and to make us slaves.
	--Galatians 2:4
%
We did not give in to them for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel might 
be preserved for you.
	--Galatians 2:5
%
As for those who were held in high esteem—whatever they were makes no 
difference to me; God does not show favoritism—they added nothing to my 
message.
	--Galatians 2:6
%
On the contrary, they recognized that I had been entrusted with the task of 
preaching the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been to the 
circumcised.
	--Galatians 2:7
%
For God, who was at work in Peter as an apostle to the circumcised, was also at 
work in me as an apostle to the Gentiles.
	--Galatians 2:8
%
James, Cephas and John, those esteemed as pillars, gave me and Barnabas the 
right hand of fellowship when they recognized the grace given to me. They 
agreed that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcised.
	--Galatians 2:9
%
All they asked was that we should continue to remember the poor, the very thing 
I had been eager to do all along.
	--Galatians 2:10
%
When Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood 
condemned.
	--Galatians 2:11
%
For before certain men came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles. But 
when they arrived, he began to draw back and separate himself from the Gentiles 
because he was afraid of those who belonged to the circumcision group.
	--Galatians 2:12
%
The other Jews joined him in his hypocrisy, so that by their hypocrisy even 
Barnabas was led astray.
	--Galatians 2:13
%
When I saw that they were not acting in line with the truth of the gospel, I 
said to Cephas in front of them all, “You are a Jew, yet you live like a 
Gentile and not like a Jew. How is it, then, that you force Gentiles to follow 
Jewish customs?
	--Galatians 2:14
%
“We who are Jews by birth and not sinful Gentiles
	--Galatians 2:15
%
know that a person is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith in 
Jesus Christ. So we, too, have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be 
justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law, because by the 
works of the law no one will be justified.
	--Galatians 2:16
%
“But if, in seeking to be justified in Christ, we Jews find ourselves also 
among the sinners, doesn’t that mean that Christ promotes sin? Absolutely not!
	--Galatians 2:17
%
If I rebuild what I destroyed, then I really would be a lawbreaker.
	--Galatians 2:18
%
“For through the law I died to the law so that I might live for God.
	--Galatians 2:19
%
I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. 
The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved 
me and gave himself for me.
	--Galatians 2:20
%
I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness could be gained 
through the law, Christ died for nothing!”
	--Galatians 2:21
%
You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? Before your very eyes Jesus 
Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified.
	--Galatians 3:1
%
I would like to learn just one thing from you: Did you receive the Spirit by 
the works of the law, or by believing what you heard?
	--Galatians 3:2
%
Are you so foolish? After beginning by means of the Spirit, are you now trying 
to finish by means of the flesh?
	--Galatians 3:3
%
Have you experienced so much in vain—if it really was in vain?
	--Galatians 3:4
%
So again I ask, does God give you his Spirit and work miracles among you by the 
works of the law, or by your believing what you heard?
	--Galatians 3:5
%
So also Abraham “believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”
	--Galatians 3:6
%
Understand, then, that those who have faith are children of Abraham.
	--Galatians 3:7
%
Scripture foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, and announced 
the gospel in advance to Abraham: “All nations will be blessed through you.”
	--Galatians 3:8
%
So those who rely on faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.
	--Galatians 3:9
%
For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse, as it is written: 
“Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the 
Book of the Law.”
	--Galatians 3:10
%
Clearly no one who relies on the law is justified before God, because “the 
righteous will live by faith.”
	--Galatians 3:11
%
The law is not based on faith; on the contrary, it says, “The person who does 
these things will live by them.”
	--Galatians 3:12
%
Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it 
is written: “Cursed is everyone who is hung on a pole.”
	--Galatians 3:13
%
He redeemed us in order that the blessing given to Abraham might come to the 
Gentiles through Christ Jesus, so that by faith we might receive the promise of 
the Spirit.
	--Galatians 3:14
%
Brothers and sisters, let me take an example from everyday life. Just as no one 
can set aside or add to a human covenant that has been duly established, so it 
is in this case.
	--Galatians 3:15
%
The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. Scripture does not say 
“and to seeds,” meaning many people, but “and to your seed,” meaning 
one person, who is Christ.
	--Galatians 3:16
%
What I mean is this: The law, introduced 430 years later, does not set aside 
the covenant previously established by God and thus do away with the promise.
	--Galatians 3:17
%
For if the inheritance depends on the law, then it no longer depends on the 
promise; but God in his grace gave it to Abraham through a promise.
	--Galatians 3:18
%
Why, then, was the law given at all? It was added because of transgressions 
until the Seed to whom the promise referred had come. The law was given through 
angels and entrusted to a mediator.
	--Galatians 3:19
%
A mediator, however, implies more than one party; but God is one.
	--Galatians 3:20
%
Is the law, therefore, opposed to the promises of God? Absolutely not! For if a 
law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would certainly 
have come by the law.
	--Galatians 3:21
%
But Scripture has locked up everything under the control of sin, so that what 
was promised, being given through faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to 
those who believe.
	--Galatians 3:22
%
Before the coming of this faith, we were held in custody under the law, locked 
up until the faith that was to come would be revealed.
	--Galatians 3:23
%
So the law was our guardian until Christ came that we might be justified by 
faith.
	--Galatians 3:24
%
Now that this faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian.
	--Galatians 3:25
%
So in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith,
	--Galatians 3:26
%
for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with 
Christ.
	--Galatians 3:27
%
There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and 
female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
	--Galatians 3:28
%
If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to 
the promise.
	--Galatians 3:29
%
What I am saying is that as long as an heir is underage, he is no different 
from a slave, although he owns the whole estate.
	--Galatians 4:1
%
The heir is subject to guardians and trustees until the time set by his father.
	--Galatians 4:2
%
So also, when we were underage, we were in slavery under the elemental 
spiritual forces of the world.
	--Galatians 4:3
%
But when the set time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born 
under the law,
	--Galatians 4:4
%
to redeem those under the law, that we might receive adoption to sonship.
	--Galatians 4:5
%
Because you are his sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the 
Spirit who calls out, “Abba, Father.”
	--Galatians 4:6
%
So you are no longer a slave, but God’s child; and since you are his child, 
God has made you also an heir.
	--Galatians 4:7
%
Formerly, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those who by nature are 
not gods.
	--Galatians 4:8
%
But now that you know God—or rather are known by God—how is it that you are 
turning back to those weak and miserable forces? Do you wish to be enslaved by 
them all over again?
	--Galatians 4:9
%
You are observing special days and months and seasons and years!
	--Galatians 4:10
%
I fear for you, that somehow I have wasted my efforts on you.
	--Galatians 4:11
%
I plead with you, brothers and sisters, become like me, for I became like you. 
You did me no wrong.
	--Galatians 4:12
%
As you know, it was because of an illness that I first preached the gospel to 
you,
	--Galatians 4:13
%
and even though my illness was a trial to you, you did not treat me with 
contempt or scorn. Instead, you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God, as if 
I were Christ Jesus himself.
	--Galatians 4:14
%
Where, then, is your blessing of me now? I can testify that, if you could have 
done so, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me.
	--Galatians 4:15
%
Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth?
	--Galatians 4:16
%
Those people are zealous to win you over, but for no good. What they want is to 
alienate you from us, so that you may have zeal for them.
	--Galatians 4:17
%
It is fine to be zealous, provided the purpose is good, and to be so always, 
not just when I am with you.
	--Galatians 4:18
%
My dear children, for whom I am again in the pains of childbirth until Christ 
is formed in you,
	--Galatians 4:19
%
how I wish I could be with you now and change my tone, because I am perplexed 
about you!
	--Galatians 4:20
%
Tell me, you who want to be under the law, are you not aware of what the law 
says?
	--Galatians 4:21
%
For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and the 
other by the free woman.
	--Galatians 4:22
%
His son by the slave woman was born according to the flesh, but his son by the 
free woman was born as the result of a divine promise.
	--Galatians 4:23
%
These things are being taken figuratively: The women represent two covenants. 
One covenant is from Mount Sinai and bears children who are to be slaves: This 
is Hagar.
	--Galatians 4:24
%
Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present city 
of Jerusalem, because she is in slavery with her children.
	--Galatians 4:25
%
But the Jerusalem that is above is free, and she is our mother.
	--Galatians 4:26
%
For it is written: “Be glad, barren woman, you who never bore a child; shout 
for joy and cry aloud, you who were never in labor; because more are the 
children of the desolate woman than of her who has a husband.”
	--Galatians 4:27
%
Now you, brothers and sisters, like Isaac, are children of promise.
	--Galatians 4:28
%
At that time the son born according to the flesh persecuted the son born by the 
power of the Spirit. It is the same now.
	--Galatians 4:29
%
But what does Scripture say? “Get rid of the slave woman and her son, for the 
slave woman’s son will never share in the inheritance with the free woman’s 
son.”
	--Galatians 4:30
%
Therefore, brothers and sisters, we are not children of the slave woman, but of 
the free woman.
	--Galatians 4:31
%
It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let 
yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery.
	--Galatians 5:1
%
Mark my words! I, Paul, tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised, 
Christ will be of no value to you at all.
	--Galatians 5:2
%
Again I declare to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is 
obligated to obey the whole law.
	--Galatians 5:3
%
You who are trying to be justified by the law have been alienated from Christ; 
you have fallen away from grace.
	--Galatians 5:4
%
For through the Spirit we eagerly await by faith the righteousness for which we 
hope.
	--Galatians 5:5
%
For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value. The 
only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love.
	--Galatians 5:6
%
You were running a good race. Who cut in on you to keep you from obeying the 
truth?
	--Galatians 5:7
%
That kind of persuasion does not come from the one who calls you.
	--Galatians 5:8
%
“A little yeast works through the whole batch of dough.”
	--Galatians 5:9
%
I am confident in the Lord that you will take no other view. The one who is 
throwing you into confusion, whoever that may be, will have to pay the penalty.
	--Galatians 5:10
%
Brothers and sisters, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still 
being persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been abolished.
	--Galatians 5:11
%
As for those agitators, I wish they would go the whole way and emasculate 
themselves!
	--Galatians 5:12
%
You, my brothers and sisters, were called to be free. But do not use your 
freedom to indulge the flesh; rather, serve one another humbly in love.
	--Galatians 5:13
%
For the entire law is fulfilled in keeping this one command: “Love your 
neighbor as yourself.”
	--Galatians 5:14
%
If you bite and devour each other, watch out or you will be destroyed by each 
other.
	--Galatians 5:15
%
So I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh.
	--Galatians 5:16
%
For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is 
contrary to the flesh. They are in conflict with each other, so that you are 
not to do whatever you want.
	--Galatians 5:17
%
But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.
	--Galatians 5:18
%
The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery;
	--Galatians 5:19
%
idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish 
ambition, dissensions, factions
	--Galatians 5:20
%
and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that 
those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God.
	--Galatians 5:21
%
But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, 
goodness, faithfulness,
	--Galatians 5:22
%
gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law.
	--Galatians 5:23
%
Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and 
desires.
	--Galatians 5:24
%
Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit.
	--Galatians 5:25
%
Let us not become conceited, provoking and envying each other.
	--Galatians 5:26
%
Brothers and sisters, if someone is caught in a sin, you who live by the Spirit 
should restore that person gently. But watch yourselves, or you also may be 
tempted.
	--Galatians 6:1
%
Carry each other’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of 
Christ.
	--Galatians 6:2
%
If anyone thinks they are something when they are not, they deceive themselves.
	--Galatians 6:3
%
Each one should test their own actions. Then they can take pride in themselves 
alone, without comparing themselves to someone else,
	--Galatians 6:4
%
for each one should carry their own load.
	--Galatians 6:5
%
Nevertheless, the one who receives instruction in the word should share all 
good things with their instructor.
	--Galatians 6:6
%
Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows.
	--Galatians 6:7
%
Whoever sows to please their flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; 
whoever sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life.
	--Galatians 6:8
%
Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a 
harvest if we do not give up.
	--Galatians 6:9
%
Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to 
those who belong to the family of believers.
	--Galatians 6:10
%
See what large letters I use as I write to you with my own hand!
	--Galatians 6:11
%
Those who want to impress people by means of the flesh are trying to compel you 
to be circumcised. The only reason they do this is to avoid being persecuted 
for the cross of Christ.
	--Galatians 6:12
%
Not even those who are circumcised keep the law, yet they want you to be 
circumcised that they may boast about your circumcision in the flesh.
	--Galatians 6:13
%
May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which 
the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.
	--Galatians 6:14
%
Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything; what counts is the new 
creation.
	--Galatians 6:15
%
Peace and mercy to all who follow this rule—to the Israel of God.
	--Galatians 6:16
%
From now on, let no one cause me trouble, for I bear on my body the marks of 
Jesus.
	--Galatians 6:17
%
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers and sisters. 
Amen.
	--Galatians 6:18
%
In the past God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets at many times and 
in various ways,
	 --Hebrews 1:1
%
but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir 
of all things, and through whom also he made the universe.
	 --Hebrews 1:2
%
The Son is the radiance of God’s glory and the exact representation of his 
being, sustaining all things by his powerful word. After he had provided 
purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven.
	 --Hebrews 1:3
%
So he became as much superior to the angels as the name he has inherited is 
superior to theirs.
	 --Hebrews 1:4
%
For to which of the angels did God ever say, “You are my Son; today I have 
become your Father”? Or again, “I will be his Father, and he will be my 
Son”?
	 --Hebrews 1:5
%
And again, when God brings his firstborn into the world, he says, “Let all 
God’s angels worship him.”
	 --Hebrews 1:6
%
In speaking of the angels he says, “He makes his angels spirits, and his 
servants flames of fire.”
	 --Hebrews 1:7
%
But about the Son he says, “Your throne, O God, will last for ever and ever; 
a scepter of justice will be the scepter of your kingdom.
	 --Hebrews 1:8
%
You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, your God, has 
set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy.”
	 --Hebrews 1:9
%
He also says, “In the beginning, Lord, you laid the foundations of the earth, 
and the heavens are the work of your hands.
	 --Hebrews 1:10
%
They will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment.
	 --Hebrews 1:11
%
You will roll them up like a robe; like a garment they will be changed. But you 
remain the same, and your years will never end.”
	 --Hebrews 1:12
%
To which of the angels did God ever say, “Sit at my right hand until I make 
your enemies a footstool for your feet”?
	 --Hebrews 1:13
%
Are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit 
salvation?
	 --Hebrews 1:14
%
We must pay the most careful attention, therefore, to what we have heard, so 
that we do not drift away.
	 --Hebrews 2:1
%
For since the message spoken through angels was binding, and every violation 
and disobedience received its just punishment,
	 --Hebrews 2:2
%
how shall we escape if we ignore so great a salvation? This salvation, which 
was first announced by the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard him.
	 --Hebrews 2:3
%
God also testified to it by signs, wonders and various miracles, and by gifts 
of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will.
	 --Hebrews 2:4
%
It is not to angels that he has subjected the world to come, about which we are 
speaking.
	 --Hebrews 2:5
%
But there is a place where someone has testified: “What is mankind that you 
are mindful of them, a son of man that you care for him?
	 --Hebrews 2:6
%
You made them a little lower than the angels; you crowned them with glory and 
honor
	 --Hebrews 2:7
%
    and put everything under their feet.” In putting everything under 
them, God left nothing that is not subject to them. Yet at present we do not 
see everything subject to them.
	 --Hebrews 2:8
%
But we do see Jesus, who was made lower than the angels for a little while, now 
crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, so that by the grace of 
God he might taste death for everyone.
	 --Hebrews 2:9
%
In bringing many sons and daughters to glory, it was fitting that God, for whom 
and through whom everything exists, should make the pioneer of their salvation 
perfect through what he suffered.
	 --Hebrews 2:10
%
Both the one who makes people holy and those who are made holy are of the same 
family. So Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters.
	 --Hebrews 2:11
%
He says, “I will declare your name to my brothers and sisters; in the 
assembly I will sing your praises.”
	 --Hebrews 2:12
%
And again, “I will put my trust in him.” And again he says, “Here am I, 
and the children God has given me.”
	 --Hebrews 2:13
%
Since the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity so 
that by his death he might break the power of him who holds the power of 
death—that is, the devil—
	 --Hebrews 2:14
%
and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death.
	 --Hebrews 2:15
%
For surely it is not angels he helps, but Abraham’s descendants.
	 --Hebrews 2:16
%
For this reason he had to be made like them, fully human in every way, in order 
that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, and 
that he might make atonement for the sins of the people.
	 --Hebrews 2:17
%
Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who 
are being tempted.
	 --Hebrews 2:18
%
Therefore, holy brothers and sisters, who share in the heavenly calling, fix 
your thoughts on Jesus, whom we acknowledge as our apostle and high priest.
	 --Hebrews 3:1
%
He was faithful to the one who appointed him, just as Moses was faithful in all 
God’s house.
	 --Hebrews 3:2
%
Jesus has been found worthy of greater honor than Moses, just as the builder of 
a house has greater honor than the house itself.
	 --Hebrews 3:3
%
For every house is built by someone, but God is the builder of everything.
	 --Hebrews 3:4
%
“Moses was faithful as a servant in all God’s house,” bearing witness to 
what would be spoken by God in the future.
	 --Hebrews 3:5
%
But Christ is faithful as the Son over God’s house. And we are his house, if 
indeed we hold firmly to our confidence and the hope in which we glory.
	 --Hebrews 3:6
%
So, as the Holy Spirit says: “Today, if you hear his voice,
	 --Hebrews 3:7
%
    do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion, during the time 
of testing in the wilderness,
	 --Hebrews 3:8
%
where your ancestors tested and tried me, though for forty years they saw what 
I did.
	 --Hebrews 3:9
%
That is why I was angry with that generation; I said, ‘Their hearts are 
always going astray, and they have not known my ways.’
	 --Hebrews 3:10
%
So I declared on oath in my anger, ‘They shall never enter my rest.’ ”
	 --Hebrews 3:11
%
See to it, brothers and sisters, that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving 
heart that turns away from the living God.
	 --Hebrews 3:12
%
But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called “Today,” so that 
none of you may be hardened by sin’s deceitfulness.
	 --Hebrews 3:13
%
We have come to share in Christ, if indeed we hold our original conviction 
firmly to the very end.
	 --Hebrews 3:14
%
As has just been said: “Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your 
hearts as you did in the rebellion.”
	 --Hebrews 3:15
%
Who were they who heard and rebelled? Were they not all those Moses led out of 
Egypt?
	 --Hebrews 3:16
%
And with whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, 
whose bodies perished in the wilderness?
	 --Hebrews 3:17
%
And to whom did God swear that they would never enter his rest if not to those 
who disobeyed?
	 --Hebrews 3:18
%
So we see that they were not able to enter, because of their unbelief.
	 --Hebrews 3:19
%
Therefore, since the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us be 
careful that none of you be found to have fallen short of it.
	 --Hebrews 4:1
%
For we also have had the good news proclaimed to us, just as they did; but the 
message they heard was of no value to them, because they did not share the 
faith of those who obeyed.
	 --Hebrews 4:2
%
Now we who have believed enter that rest, just as God has said, “So I 
declared on oath in my anger, ‘They shall never enter my rest.’” And yet 
his works have been finished since the creation of the world.
	 --Hebrews 4:3
%
For somewhere he has spoken about the seventh day in these words: “On the 
seventh day God rested from all his works.”
	 --Hebrews 4:4
%
And again in the passage above he says, “They shall never enter my rest.”
	 --Hebrews 4:5
%
Therefore since it still remains for some to enter that rest, and since those 
who formerly had the good news proclaimed to them did not go in because of 
their disobedience,
	 --Hebrews 4:6
%
God again set a certain day, calling it “Today.” This he did when a long 
time later he spoke through David, as in the passage already quoted: “Today, 
if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts.”
	 --Hebrews 4:7
%
For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later about 
another day.
	 --Hebrews 4:8
%
There remains, then, a Sabbath-rest for the people of God;
	 --Hebrews 4:9
%
for anyone who enters God’s rest also rests from their works, just as God did 
from his.
	 --Hebrews 4:10
%
Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will 
perish by following their example of disobedience.
	 --Hebrews 4:11
%
For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, 
it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges 
the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.
	 --Hebrews 4:12
%
Nothing in all creation is hidden from God’s sight. Everything is uncovered 
and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give account.
	 --Hebrews 4:13
%
Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has ascended into heaven, 
Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess.
	 --Hebrews 4:14
%
For we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our 
weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we 
are—yet he did not sin.
	 --Hebrews 4:15
%
Let us then approach God’s throne of grace with confidence, so that we may 
receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.
	 --Hebrews 4:16
%
Every high priest is selected from among the people and is appointed to 
represent the people in matters related to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices 
for sins.
	 --Hebrews 5:1
%
He is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and are going astray, 
since he himself is subject to weakness.
	 --Hebrews 5:2
%
This is why he has to offer sacrifices for his own sins, as well as for the 
sins of the people.
	 --Hebrews 5:3
%
And no one takes this honor on himself, but he receives it when called by God, 
just as Aaron was.
	 --Hebrews 5:4
%
In the same way, Christ did not take on himself the glory of becoming a high 
priest. But God said to him, “You are my Son; today I have become your 
Father.”
	 --Hebrews 5:5
%
And he says in another place, “You are a priest forever, in the order of 
Melchizedek.”
	 --Hebrews 5:6
%
During the days of Jesus’ life on earth, he offered up prayers and petitions 
with fervent cries and tears to the one who could save him from death, and he 
was heard because of his reverent submission.
	 --Hebrews 5:7
%
Son though he was, he learned obedience from what he suffered
	 --Hebrews 5:8
%
and, once made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who 
obey him
	 --Hebrews 5:9
%
and was designated by God to be high priest in the order of Melchizedek.
	 --Hebrews 5:10
%
We have much to say about this, but it is hard to make it clear to you because 
you no longer try to understand.
	 --Hebrews 5:11
%
In fact, though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to 
teach you the elementary truths of God’s word all over again. You need milk, 
not solid food!
	 --Hebrews 5:12
%
Anyone who lives on milk, being still an infant, is not acquainted with the 
teaching about righteousness.
	 --Hebrews 5:13
%
But solid food is for the mature, who by constant use have trained themselves 
to distinguish good from evil.
	 --Hebrews 5:14
%
Therefore let us move beyond the elementary teachings about Christ and be taken 
forward to maturity, not laying again the foundation of repentance from acts 
that lead to death, and of faith in God,
	 --Hebrews 6:1
%
instruction about cleansing rites, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of 
the dead, and eternal judgment.
	 --Hebrews 6:2
%
And God permitting, we will do so.
	 --Hebrews 6:3
%
It is impossible for those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the 
heavenly gift, who have shared in the Holy Spirit,
	 --Hebrews 6:4
%
who have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the coming age
	 --Hebrews 6:5
%
and who have fallen away, to be brought back to repentance. To their loss they 
are crucifying the Son of God all over again and subjecting him to public 
disgrace.
	 --Hebrews 6:6
%
Land that drinks in the rain often falling on it and that produces a crop 
useful to those for whom it is farmed receives the blessing of God.
	 --Hebrews 6:7
%
But land that produces thorns and thistles is worthless and is in danger of 
being cursed. In the end it will be burned.
	 --Hebrews 6:8
%
Even though we speak like this, dear friends, we are convinced of better things 
in your case—the things that have to do with salvation.
	 --Hebrews 6:9
%
God is not unjust; he will not forget your work and the love you have shown him 
as you have helped his people and continue to help them.
	 --Hebrews 6:10
%
We want each of you to show this same diligence to the very end, so that what 
you hope for may be fully realized.
	 --Hebrews 6:11
%
We do not want you to become lazy, but to imitate those who through faith and 
patience inherit what has been promised.
	 --Hebrews 6:12
%
When God made his promise to Abraham, since there was no one greater for him to 
swear by, he swore by himself,
	 --Hebrews 6:13
%
saying, “I will surely bless you and give you many descendants.”
	 --Hebrews 6:14
%
And so after waiting patiently, Abraham received what was promised.
	 --Hebrews 6:15
%
People swear by someone greater than themselves, and the oath confirms what is 
said and puts an end to all argument.
	 --Hebrews 6:16
%
Because God wanted to make the unchanging nature of his purpose very clear to 
the heirs of what was promised, he confirmed it with an oath.
	 --Hebrews 6:17
%
God did this so that, by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for 
God to lie, we who have fled to take hold of the hope set before us may be 
greatly encouraged.
	 --Hebrews 6:18
%
We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure. It enters the 
inner sanctuary behind the curtain,
	 --Hebrews 6:19
%
where our forerunner, Jesus, has entered on our behalf. He has become a high 
priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.
	 --Hebrews 6:20
%
This Melchizedek was king of Salem and priest of God Most High. He met Abraham 
returning from the defeat of the kings and blessed him,
	 --Hebrews 7:1
%
and Abraham gave him a tenth of everything. First, the name Melchizedek means 
“king of righteousness”; then also, “king of Salem” means “king of 
peace.”
	 --Hebrews 7:2
%
Without father or mother, without genealogy, without beginning of days or end 
of life, resembling the Son of God, he remains a priest forever.
	 --Hebrews 7:3
%
Just think how great he was: Even the patriarch Abraham gave him a tenth of the 
plunder!
	 --Hebrews 7:4
%
Now the law requires the descendants of Levi who become priests to collect a 
tenth from the people—that is, from their fellow Israelites—even though 
they also are descended from Abraham.
	 --Hebrews 7:5
%
This man, however, did not trace his descent from Levi, yet he collected a 
tenth from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises.
	 --Hebrews 7:6
%
And without doubt the lesser is blessed by the greater.
	 --Hebrews 7:7
%
In the one case, the tenth is collected by people who die; but in the other 
case, by him who is declared to be living.
	 --Hebrews 7:8
%
One might even say that Levi, who collects the tenth, paid the tenth through 
Abraham,
	 --Hebrews 7:9
%
because when Melchizedek met Abraham, Levi was still in the body of his 
ancestor.
	 --Hebrews 7:10
%
If perfection could have been attained through the Levitical priesthood—and 
indeed the law given to the people established that priesthood—why was there 
still need for another priest to come, one in the order of Melchizedek, not in 
the order of Aaron?
	 --Hebrews 7:11
%
For when the priesthood is changed, the law must be changed also.
	 --Hebrews 7:12
%
He of whom these things are said belonged to a different tribe, and no one from 
that tribe has ever served at the altar.
	 --Hebrews 7:13
%
For it is clear that our Lord descended from Judah, and in regard to that tribe 
Moses said nothing about priests.
	 --Hebrews 7:14
%
And what we have said is even more clear if another priest like Melchizedek 
appears,
	 --Hebrews 7:15
%
one who has become a priest not on the basis of a regulation as to his ancestry 
but on the basis of the power of an indestructible life.
	 --Hebrews 7:16
%
For it is declared: “You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.”
	 --Hebrews 7:17
%
The former regulation is set aside because it was weak and useless
	 --Hebrews 7:18
%
(for the law made nothing perfect), and a better hope is introduced, by which 
we draw near to God.
	 --Hebrews 7:19
%
And it was not without an oath! Others became priests without any oath,
	 --Hebrews 7:20
%
but he became a priest with an oath when God said to him: “The Lord has sworn 
and will not change his mind: ‘You are a priest forever.’”
	 --Hebrews 7:21
%
Because of this oath, Jesus has become the guarantor of a better covenant.
	 --Hebrews 7:22
%
Now there have been many of those priests, since death prevented them from 
continuing in office;
	 --Hebrews 7:23
%
but because Jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood.
	 --Hebrews 7:24
%
Therefore he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, 
because he always lives to intercede for them.
	 --Hebrews 7:25

Such a high priest truly meets our need—one who is holy, blameless, pure, set 
apart from sinners, exalted above the heavens.
	 --Hebrews 7:26
%
Unlike the other high priests, he does not need to offer sacrifices day after 
day, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. He sacrificed 
for their sins once for all when he offered himself.
	 --Hebrews 7:27
%
For the law appoints as high priests men in all their weakness; but the oath, 
which came after the law, appointed the Son, who has been made perfect forever.
	 --Hebrews 7:28
%
Now the main point of what we are saying is this: We do have such a high 
priest, who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven,
	 --Hebrews 8:1
%
and who serves in the sanctuary, the true tabernacle set up by the Lord, not by 
a mere human being.
	 --Hebrews 8:2
%
Every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices, and so it 
was necessary for this one also to have something to offer.
	 --Hebrews 8:3
%
If he were on earth, he would not be a priest, for there are already priests 
who offer the gifts prescribed by the law.
	 --Hebrews 8:4
%
They serve at a sanctuary that is a copy and shadow of what is in heaven. This 
is why Moses was warned when he was about to build the tabernacle: “See to it 
that you make everything according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.”
	 --Hebrews 8:5
%
But in fact the ministry Jesus has received is as superior to theirs as the 
covenant of which he is mediator is superior to the old one, since the new 
covenant is established on better promises.
	 --Hebrews 8:6
%
For if there had been nothing wrong with that first covenant, no place would 
have been sought for another.
	 --Hebrews 8:7
%
But God found fault with the people and said: “The days are coming, declares 
the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and with 
the people of Judah.
	 --Hebrews 8:8
%
It will not be like the covenant I made with their ancestors when I took them 
by the hand to lead them out of Egypt, because they did not remain faithful to 
my covenant, and I turned away from them, declares the Lord.
	 --Hebrews 8:9
%
This is the covenant I will establish with the people of Israel after that 
time, declares the Lord. I will put my laws in their minds and write them on 
their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people.
	 --Hebrews 8:10
%
No longer will they teach their neighbor, or say to one another, ‘Know the 
Lord,’ because they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest.
	 --Hebrews 8:11
%
For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.”
	 --Hebrews 8:12
%
By calling this covenant “new,” he has made the first one obsolete; and 
what is obsolete and outdated will soon disappear.
	 --Hebrews 8:13
%
Now the first covenant had regulations for worship and also an earthly 
sanctuary.
	 --Hebrews 9:1
%
A tabernacle was set up. In its first room were the lampstand and the table 
with its consecrated bread; this was called the Holy Place.
	 --Hebrews 9:2
%
Behind the second curtain was a room called the Most Holy Place,
	 --Hebrews 9:3
%
which had the golden altar of incense and the gold-covered ark of the covenant. 
This ark contained the gold jar of manna, Aaron’s staff that had budded, and 
the stone tablets of the covenant.
	 --Hebrews 9:4
%
Above the ark were the cherubim of the Glory, overshadowing the atonement 
cover. But we cannot discuss these things in detail now.
	 --Hebrews 9:5
%
When everything had been arranged like this, the priests entered regularly into 
the outer room to carry on their ministry.
	 --Hebrews 9:6
%
But only the high priest entered the inner room, and that only once a year, and 
never without blood, which he offered for himself and for the sins the people 
had committed in ignorance.
	 --Hebrews 9:7
%
The Holy Spirit was showing by this that the way into the Most Holy Place had 
not yet been disclosed as long as the first tabernacle was still functioning.
	 --Hebrews 9:8
%
This is an illustration for the present time, indicating that the gifts and 
sacrifices being offered were not able to clear the conscience of the worshiper.
	 --Hebrews 9:9
%
They are only a matter of food and drink and various ceremonial 
washings—external regulations applying until the time of the new order.
	 --Hebrews 9:10
%
But when Christ came as high priest of the good things that are now already 
here, he went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that is not made 
with human hands, that is to say, is not a part of this creation.
	 --Hebrews 9:11
%
He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves; but he entered the 
Most Holy Place once for all by his own blood, thus obtaining eternal 
redemption.
	 --Hebrews 9:12
%
The blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who 
are ceremonially unclean sanctify them so that they are outwardly clean.
	 --Hebrews 9:13
%
How much more, then, will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit 
offered himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences from acts that lead 
to death, so that we may serve the living God!
	 --Hebrews 9:14
%
For this reason Christ is the mediator of a new covenant, that those who are 
called may receive the promised eternal inheritance—now that he has died as a 
ransom to set them free from the sins committed under the first covenant.
	 --Hebrews 9:15
%
In the case of a will, it is necessary to prove the death of the one who made 
it,
	 --Hebrews 9:16
%
because a will is in force only when somebody has died; it never takes effect 
while the one who made it is living.
	 --Hebrews 9:17
%
This is why even the first covenant was not put into effect without blood.
	 --Hebrews 9:18
%
When Moses had proclaimed every command of the law to all the people, he took 
the blood of calves, together with water, scarlet wool and branches of hyssop, 
and sprinkled the scroll and all the people.
	 --Hebrews 9:19
%
He said, “This is the blood of the covenant, which God has commanded you to 
keep.”
	 --Hebrews 9:20
%
In the same way, he sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle and everything 
used in its ceremonies.
	 --Hebrews 9:21
%
In fact, the law requires that nearly everything be cleansed with blood, and 
without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.
	 --Hebrews 9:22
%
It was necessary, then, for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified 
with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves with better 
sacrifices than these.
	 --Hebrews 9:23
%
For Christ did not enter a sanctuary made with human hands that was only a copy 
of the true one; he entered heaven itself, now to appear for us in God’s 
presence.
	 --Hebrews 9:24
%
Nor did he enter heaven to offer himself again and again, the way the high 
priest enters the Most Holy Place every year with blood that is not his own.
	 --Hebrews 9:25
%
Otherwise Christ would have had to suffer many times since the creation of the 
world. But he has appeared once for all at the culmination of the ages to do 
away with sin by the sacrifice of himself.
	 --Hebrews 9:26
%
Just as people are destined to die once, and after that to face judgment,
	 --Hebrews 9:27
%
so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many; and he will appear 
a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting 
for him.
	 --Hebrews 9:28
%
The law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming—not the realities 
themselves. For this reason it can never, by the same sacrifices repeated 
endlessly year after year, make perfect those who draw near to worship.
	 --Hebrews 10:1
%
Otherwise, would they not have stopped being offered? For the worshipers would 
have been cleansed once for all, and would no longer have felt guilty for their 
sins.
	 --Hebrews 10:2
%
But those sacrifices are an annual reminder of sins.
	 --Hebrews 10:3
%
It is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
	 --Hebrews 10:4
%
Therefore, when Christ came into the world, he said: “Sacrifice and offering 
you did not desire, but a body you prepared for me;
	 --Hebrews 10:5
%
with burnt offerings and sin offerings you were not pleased.
	 --Hebrews 10:6
%
Then I said, ‘Here I am—it is written about me in the scroll— I have come 
to do your will, my God.’”
	 --Hebrews 10:7
%
First he said, “Sacrifices and offerings, burnt offerings and sin offerings 
you did not desire, nor were you pleased with them”—though they were 
offered in accordance with the law.
	 --Hebrews 10:8
%
Then he said, “Here I am, I have come to do your will.” He sets aside the 
first to establish the second.
	 --Hebrews 10:9
%
And by that will, we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of 
Jesus Christ once for all.
	 --Hebrews 10:10
%
Day after day every priest stands and performs his religious duties; again and 
again he offers the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.
	 --Hebrews 10:11
%
But when this priest had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, he sat 
down at the right hand of God,
	 --Hebrews 10:12
%
and since that time he waits for his enemies to be made his footstool.
	 --Hebrews 10:13
%
For by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being made holy.
	 --Hebrews 10:14
%
The Holy Spirit also testifies to us about this. First he says:
	 --Hebrews 10:15
%
“This is the covenant I will make with them after that time, says the Lord. I 
will put my laws in their hearts, and I will write them on their minds.”
	 --Hebrews 10:16
%
Then he adds: “Their sins and lawless acts I will remember no more.”
	 --Hebrews 10:17
%
And where these have been forgiven, sacrifice for sin is no longer necessary.
	 --Hebrews 10:18
%
Therefore, brothers and sisters, since we have confidence to enter the Most 
Holy Place by the blood of Jesus,
	 --Hebrews 10:19
%
by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain, that is, his body,
	 --Hebrews 10:20
%
and since we have a great priest over the house of God,
	 --Hebrews 10:21
%
let us draw near to God with a sincere heart and with the full assurance that 
faith brings, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty 
conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water.
	 --Hebrews 10:22
%
Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is 
faithful.
	 --Hebrews 10:23
%
And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds,
	 --Hebrews 10:24
%
not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but 
encouraging one another—and all the more as you see the Day approaching.
	 --Hebrews 10:25
%
If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the 
truth, no sacrifice for sins is left,
	 --Hebrews 10:26
%
but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume 
the enemies of God.
	 --Hebrews 10:27
%
Anyone who rejected the law of Moses died without mercy on the testimony of two 
or three witnesses.
	 --Hebrews 10:28
%
How much more severely do you think someone deserves to be punished who has 
trampled the Son of God underfoot, who has treated as an unholy thing the blood 
of the covenant that sanctified them, and who has insulted the Spirit of grace?
	 --Hebrews 10:29
%
For we know him who said, “It is mine to avenge; I will repay,” and again, 
“The Lord will judge his people.”
	 --Hebrews 10:30
%
It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
	 --Hebrews 10:31
%
Remember those earlier days after you had received the light, when you endured 
in a great conflict full of suffering.
	 --Hebrews 10:32
%
Sometimes you were publicly exposed to insult and persecution; at other times 
you stood side by side with those who were so treated.
	 --Hebrews 10:33
%
You suffered along with those in prison and joyfully accepted the confiscation 
of your property, because you knew that you yourselves had better and lasting 
possessions.
	 --Hebrews 10:34
%
So do not throw away your confidence; it will be richly rewarded.
	 --Hebrews 10:35
%
You need to persevere so that when you have done the will of God, you will 
receive what he has promised.
	 --Hebrews 10:36
%
For, “In just a little while, he who is coming will come and will not 
delay.”
	 --Hebrews 10:37
%
And, “But my righteous one will live by faith. And I take no pleasure in the 
one who shrinks back.”
	 --Hebrews 10:38
%
But we do not belong to those who shrink back and are destroyed, but to those 
who have faith and are saved.
	 --Hebrews 10:39
%
Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not 
see.
	 --Hebrews 11:1
%
This is what the ancients were commended for.
	 --Hebrews 11:2
%
By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God’s command, so that 
what is seen was not made out of what was visible.
	 --Hebrews 11:3
%
By faith Abel brought God a better offering than Cain did. By faith he was 
commended as righteous, when God spoke well of his offerings. And by faith Abel 
still speaks, even though he is dead.
	 --Hebrews 11:4
%
By faith Enoch was taken from this life, so that he did not experience death: 
“He could not be found, because God had taken him away.” For before he was 
taken, he was commended as one who pleased God.
	 --Hebrews 11:5
%
And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to 
him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek 
him.
	 --Hebrews 11:6
%
By faith Noah, when warned about things not yet seen, in holy fear built an ark 
to save his family. By his faith he condemned the world and became heir of the 
righteousness that is in keeping with faith.
	 --Hebrews 11:7
%
By faith Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his 
inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going.
	 --Hebrews 11:8
%
By faith he made his home in the promised land like a stranger in a foreign 
country; he lived in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of 
the same promise.
	 --Hebrews 11:9
%
For he was looking forward to the city with foundations, whose architect and 
builder is God.
	 --Hebrews 11:10
%
And by faith even Sarah, who was past childbearing age, was enabled to bear 
children because she considered him faithful who had made the promise.
	 --Hebrews 11:11
%
And so from this one man, and he as good as dead, came descendants as numerous 
as the stars in the sky and as countless as the sand on the seashore.
	 --Hebrews 11:12
%
All these people were still living by faith when they died. They did not 
receive the things promised; they only saw them and welcomed them from a 
distance, admitting that they were foreigners and strangers on earth.
	 --Hebrews 11:13
%
People who say such things show that they are looking for a country of their 
own.
	 --Hebrews 11:14
%
If they had been thinking of the country they had left, they would have had 
opportunity to return.
	 --Hebrews 11:15
%
Instead, they were longing for a better country—a heavenly one. Therefore God 
is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them.
	 --Hebrews 11:16
%
By faith Abraham, when God tested him, offered Isaac as a sacrifice. He who had 
embraced the promises was about to sacrifice his one and only son,
	 --Hebrews 11:17
%
even though God had said to him, “It is through Isaac that your offspring 
will be reckoned.”
	 --Hebrews 11:18
%
Abraham reasoned that God could even raise the dead, and so in a manner of 
speaking he did receive Isaac back from death.
	 --Hebrews 11:19
%
By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau in regard to their future.
	 --Hebrews 11:20
%
By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of Joseph’s sons, and 
worshiped as he leaned on the top of his staff.
	 --Hebrews 11:21
%
By faith Joseph, when his end was near, spoke about the exodus of the 
Israelites from Egypt and gave instructions concerning the burial of his bones.
	 --Hebrews 11:22
%
By faith Moses’ parents hid him for three months after he was born, because 
they saw he was no ordinary child, and they were not afraid of the king’s 
edict.
	 --Hebrews 11:23
%
By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be known as the son of 
Pharaoh’s daughter.
	 --Hebrews 11:24
%
He chose to be mistreated along with the people of God rather than to enjoy the 
fleeting pleasures of sin.
	 --Hebrews 11:25
%
He regarded disgrace for the sake of Christ as of greater value than the 
treasures of Egypt, because he was looking ahead to his reward.
	 --Hebrews 11:26
%
By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the king’s anger; he persevered because 
he saw him who is invisible.
	 --Hebrews 11:27
%
By faith he kept the Passover and the application of blood, so that the 
destroyer of the firstborn would not touch the firstborn of Israel.
	 --Hebrews 11:28
%
By faith the people passed through the Red Sea as on dry land; but when the 
Egyptians tried to do so, they were drowned.
	 --Hebrews 11:29
%
By faith the walls of Jericho fell, after the army had marched around them for 
seven days.
	 --Hebrews 11:30
%
By faith the prostitute Rahab, because she welcomed the spies, was not killed 
with those who were disobedient.
	 --Hebrews 11:31
%
And what more shall I say? I do not have time to tell about Gideon, Barak, 
Samson and Jephthah, about David and Samuel and the prophets,
	 --Hebrews 11:32
%
who through faith conquered kingdoms, administered justice, and gained what was 
promised; who shut the mouths of lions,
	 --Hebrews 11:33
%
quenched the fury of the flames, and escaped the edge of the sword; whose 
weakness was turned to strength; and who became powerful in battle and routed 
foreign armies.
	 --Hebrews 11:34
%
Women received back their dead, raised to life again. There were others who 
were tortured, refusing to be released so that they might gain an even better 
resurrection.
	 --Hebrews 11:35
%
Some faced jeers and flogging, and even chains and imprisonment.
	 --Hebrews 11:36
%
They were put to death by stoning; they were sawed in two; they were killed by 
the sword. They went about in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, persecuted 
and mistreated—
	 --Hebrews 11:37
%
the world was not worthy of them. They wandered in deserts and mountains, 
living in caves and in holes in the ground.
	 --Hebrews 11:38
%
These were all commended for their faith, yet none of them received what had 
been promised,
	 --Hebrews 11:39
%
since God had planned something better for us so that only together with us 
would they be made perfect.
	 --Hebrews 11:40
%
Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us 
throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles. And let 
us run with perseverance the race marked out for us,
	 --Hebrews 12:1
%
fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set 
before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right 
hand of the throne of God.
	 --Hebrews 12:2
%
Consider him who endured such opposition from sinners, so that you will not 
grow weary and lose heart.
	 --Hebrews 12:3
%
In your struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of 
shedding your blood.
	 --Hebrews 12:4
%
And have you completely forgotten this word of encouragement that addresses you 
as a father addresses his son? It says, “My son, do not make light of the 
Lord’s discipline, and do not lose heart when he rebukes you,
	 --Hebrews 12:5
%
because the Lord disciplines the one he loves, and he chastens everyone he 
accepts as his son.”
	 --Hebrews 12:6
%
Endure hardship as discipline; God is treating you as his children. For what 
children are not disciplined by their father?
	 --Hebrews 12:7
%
If you are not disciplined—and everyone undergoes discipline—then you are 
not legitimate, not true sons and daughters at all.
	 --Hebrews 12:8
%
Moreover, we have all had human fathers who disciplined us and we respected 
them for it. How much more should we submit to the Father of spirits and live!
	 --Hebrews 12:9
%
They disciplined us for a little while as they thought best; but God 
disciplines us for our good, in order that we may share in his holiness.
	 --Hebrews 12:10
%
No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it 
produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained 
by it.
	 --Hebrews 12:11
%
Therefore, strengthen your feeble arms and weak knees.
	 --Hebrews 12:12
%
“Make level paths for your feet,” so that the lame may not be disabled, but 
rather healed.
	 --Hebrews 12:13
%
Make every effort to live in peace with everyone and to be holy; without 
holiness no one will see the Lord.
	 --Hebrews 12:14
%
See to it that no one falls short of the grace of God and that no bitter root 
grows up to cause trouble and defile many.
	 --Hebrews 12:15
%
See that no one is sexually immoral, or is godless like Esau, who for a single 
meal sold his inheritance rights as the oldest son.
	 --Hebrews 12:16
%
Afterward, as you know, when he wanted to inherit this blessing, he was 
rejected. Even though he sought the blessing with tears, he could not change 
what he had done.
	 --Hebrews 12:17
%
You have not come to a mountain that can be touched and that is burning with 
fire; to darkness, gloom and storm;
	 --Hebrews 12:18
%
to a trumpet blast or to such a voice speaking words that those who heard it 
begged that no further word be spoken to them,
	 --Hebrews 12:19
%
because they could not bear what was commanded: “If even an animal touches 
the mountain, it must be stoned to death.”
	 --Hebrews 12:20
%
The sight was so terrifying that Moses said, “I am trembling with fear.”
	 --Hebrews 12:21
%
But you have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God, the heavenly 
Jerusalem. You have come to thousands upon thousands of angels in joyful 
assembly,
	 --Hebrews 12:22
%
to the church of the firstborn, whose names are written in heaven. You have 
come to God, the Judge of all, to the spirits of the righteous made perfect,
	 --Hebrews 12:23
%
to Jesus the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks 
a better word than the blood of Abel.
	 --Hebrews 12:24
%
See to it that you do not refuse him who speaks. If they did not escape when 
they refused him who warned them on earth, how much less will we, if we turn 
away from him who warns us from heaven?
	 --Hebrews 12:25
%
At that time his voice shook the earth, but now he has promised, “Once more I 
will shake not only the earth but also the heavens.”
	 --Hebrews 12:26
%
The words “once more” indicate the removing of what can be shaken—that 
is, created things—so that what cannot be shaken may remain.
	 --Hebrews 12:27
%
Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be 
thankful, and so worship God acceptably with reverence and awe,
	 --Hebrews 12:28
%
for our “God is a consuming fire.”
	 --Hebrews 12:29
%
Keep on loving one another as brothers and sisters.
	 --Hebrews 13:1
%
Do not forget to show hospitality to strangers, for by so doing some people 
have shown hospitality to angels without knowing it.
	 --Hebrews 13:2
%
Continue to remember those in prison as if you were together with them in 
prison, and those who are mistreated as if you yourselves were suffering.
	 --Hebrews 13:3
%
Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will 
judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral.
	 --Hebrews 13:4
%
Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, 
because God has said, “Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.”
	 --Hebrews 13:5
%
So we say with confidence, “The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid. What 
can mere mortals do to me?”
	 --Hebrews 13:6
%
Remember your leaders, who spoke the word of God to you. Consider the outcome 
of their way of life and imitate their faith.
	 --Hebrews 13:7
%
Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.
	 --Hebrews 13:8
%
Do not be carried away by all kinds of strange teachings. It is good for our 
hearts to be strengthened by grace, not by eating ceremonial foods, which is of 
no benefit to those who do so.
	 --Hebrews 13:9
%
We have an altar from which those who minister at the tabernacle have no right 
to eat.
	 --Hebrews 13:10
%
The high priest carries the blood of animals into the Most Holy Place as a sin 
offering, but the bodies are burned outside the camp.
	 --Hebrews 13:11
%
And so Jesus also suffered outside the city gate to make the people holy 
through his own blood.
	 --Hebrews 13:12
%
Let us, then, go to him outside the camp, bearing the disgrace he bore.
	 --Hebrews 13:13
%
For here we do not have an enduring city, but we are looking for the city that 
is to come.
	 --Hebrews 13:14
%
Through Jesus, therefore, let us continually offer to God a sacrifice of 
praise—the fruit of lips that openly profess his name.
	 --Hebrews 13:15
%
And do not forget to do good and to share with others, for with such sacrifices 
God is pleased.
	 --Hebrews 13:16
%
Have confidence in your leaders and submit to their authority, because they 
keep watch over you as those who must give an account. Do this so that their 
work will be a joy, not a burden, for that would be of no benefit to you.
	 --Hebrews 13:17
%
Pray for us. We are sure that we have a clear conscience and desire to live 
honorably in every way.
	 --Hebrews 13:18
%
I particularly urge you to pray so that I may be restored to you soon.
	 --Hebrews 13:19
%
Now may the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant brought 
back from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep,
	 --Hebrews 13:20
%
equip you with everything good for doing his will, and may he work in us what 
is pleasing to him, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever. 
Amen.
	 --Hebrews 13:21
%
Brothers and sisters, I urge you to bear with my word of exhortation, for in 
fact I have written to you quite briefly.
	 --Hebrews 13:22
%
I want you to know that our brother Timothy has been released. If he arrives 
soon, I will come with him to see you.
	 --Hebrews 13:23
%
Greet all your leaders and all the Lord’s people. Those from Italy send you 
their greetings.
	 --Hebrews 13:24
%
Grace be with you all.
	 --Hebrews 13:25
%James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, To the twelve tribes 
scattered among the nations: Greetings.
	 --James 1:1
%
Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many 
kinds,
	 --James 1:2
%
because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance.
	 --James 1:3
%
Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not 
lacking anything.
	 --James 1:4
%
If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all 
without finding fault, and it will be given to you.
	 --James 1:5
%
But when you ask, you must believe and not doubt, because the one who doubts is 
like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind.
	 --James 1:6
%
That person should not expect to receive anything from the Lord.
	 --James 1:7
%
Such a person is double-minded and unstable in all they do.
	 --James 1:8
%
Believers in humble circumstances ought to take pride in their high position.
	 --James 1:9
%
But the rich should take pride in their humiliation—since they will pass away 
like a wild flower.
	 --James 1:10
%
For the sun rises with scorching heat and withers the plant; its blossom falls 
and its beauty is destroyed. In the same way, the rich will fade away even 
while they go about their business.
	 --James 1:11
%
Blessed is the one who perseveres under trial because, having stood the test, 
that person will receive the crown of life that the Lord has promised to those 
who love him.
	 --James 1:12
%
When tempted, no one should say, “God is tempting me.” For God cannot be 
tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone;
	 --James 1:13
%
but each person is tempted when they are dragged away by their own evil desire 
and enticed.
	 --James 1:14
%
Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is 
full-grown, gives birth to death.
	 --James 1:15
%
Don’t be deceived, my dear brothers and sisters.
	 --James 1:16
%
Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the 
heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows.
	 --James 1:17
%
He chose to give us birth through the word of truth, that we might be a kind of 
firstfruits of all he created.
	 --James 1:18
%
My dear brothers and sisters, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to 
listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry,
	 --James 1:19
%
because human anger does not produce the righteousness that God desires.
	 --James 1:20
%
Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent and 
humbly accept the word planted in you, which can save you.
	 --James 1:21
%
Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says.
	 --James 1:22
%
Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like someone who 
looks at his face in a mirror
	 --James 1:23
%
and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks 
like.
	 --James 1:24
%
But whoever looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and 
continues in it—not forgetting what they have heard, but doing it—they will 
be blessed in what they do.
	 --James 1:25
%
Those who consider themselves religious and yet do not keep a tight rein on 
their tongues deceive themselves, and their religion is worthless.
	 --James 1:26
%
Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look 
after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being 
polluted by the world.
	 --James 1:27
%
My brothers and sisters, believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ must not 
show favoritism.
	 --James 2:1
%
Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes, and 
a poor man in filthy old clothes also comes in.
	 --James 2:2
%
If you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say, 
“Here’s a good seat for you,” but say to the poor man, “You stand 
there” or “Sit on the floor by my feet,”
	 --James 2:3
%
have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil 
thoughts?
	 --James 2:4
%
Listen, my dear brothers and sisters: Has not God chosen those who are poor in 
the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom he 
promised those who love him?
	 --James 2:5
%
But you have dishonored the poor. Is it not the rich who are exploiting you? 
Are they not the ones who are dragging you into court?
	 --James 2:6
%
Are they not the ones who are blaspheming the noble name of him to whom you 
belong?
	 --James 2:7
%
If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as 
yourself,” you are doing right.
	 --James 2:8
%
But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers.
	 --James 2:9
%
For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of 
breaking all of it.
	 --James 2:10
%
For he who said, “You shall not commit adultery,” also said, “You shall 
not murder.” If you do not commit adultery but do commit murder, you have 
become a lawbreaker.
	 --James 2:11
%
Speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom,
	 --James 2:12
%
because judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been 
merciful. Mercy triumphs over judgment.
	 --James 2:13
%
What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but 
has no deeds? Can such faith save them?
	 --James 2:14
%
Suppose a brother or a sister is without clothes and daily food.
	 --James 2:15
%
If one of you says to them, “Go in peace; keep warm and well fed,” but does 
nothing about their physical needs, what good is it?
	 --James 2:16
%
In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.
	 --James 2:17
%
But someone will say, “You have faith; I have deeds.” Show me your faith 
without deeds, and I will show you my faith by my deeds.
	 --James 2:18
%
You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that—and 
shudder.
	 --James 2:19
%
You foolish person, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless?
	 --James 2:20
%
Was not our father Abraham considered righteous for what he did when he offered 
his son Isaac on the altar?
	 --James 2:21
%
You see that his faith and his actions were working together, and his faith was 
made complete by what he did.
	 --James 2:22
%
And the scripture was fulfilled that says, “Abraham believed God, and it was 
credited to him as righteousness,” and he was called God’s friend.
	 --James 2:23
%
You see that a person is considered righteous by what they do and not by faith 
alone.
	 --James 2:24
%
In the same way, was not even Rahab the prostitute considered righteous for 
what she did when she gave lodging to the spies and sent them off in a 
different direction?
	 --James 2:25
%
As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is dead.
	 --James 2:26
%
Not many of you should become teachers, my fellow believers, because you know 
that we who teach will be judged more strictly.
	 --James 3:1
%
We all stumble in many ways. Anyone who is never at fault in what they say is 
perfect, able to keep their whole body in check.
	 --James 3:2
%
When we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we can turn 
the whole animal.
	 --James 3:3
%
Or take ships as an example. Although they are so large and are driven by 
strong winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot wants 
to go.
	 --James 3:4
%
Likewise, the tongue is a small part of the body, but it makes great boasts. 
Consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark.
	 --James 3:5
%
The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body. It 
corrupts the whole body, sets the whole course of one’s life on fire, and is 
itself set on fire by hell.
	 --James 3:6
%
All kinds of animals, birds, reptiles and sea creatures are being tamed and 
have been tamed by mankind,
	 --James 3:7
%
but no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly 
poison.
	 --James 3:8
%
With the tongue we praise our Lord and Father, and with it we curse human 
beings, who have been made in God’s likeness.
	 --James 3:9
%
Out of the same mouth come praise and cursing. My brothers and sisters, this 
should not be.
	 --James 3:10
%
Can both fresh water and salt water flow from the same spring?
	 --James 3:11
%
My brothers and sisters, can a fig tree bear olives, or a grapevine bear figs? 
Neither can a salt spring produce fresh water.
	 --James 3:12
%
Who is wise and understanding among you? Let them show it by their good life, 
by deeds done in the humility that comes from wisdom.
	 --James 3:13
%
But if you harbor bitter envy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast 
about it or deny the truth.
	 --James 3:14
%
Such “wisdom” does not come down from heaven but is earthly, unspiritual, 
demonic.
	 --James 3:15
%
For where you have envy and selfish ambition, there you find disorder and every 
evil practice.
	 --James 3:16
%
But the wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure; then peace-loving, 
considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere.
	 --James 3:17
%
Peacemakers who sow in peace reap a harvest of righteousness.
	 --James 3:18
%
What causes fights and quarrels among you? Don’t they come from your desires 
that battle within you?
	 --James 4:1
%
You desire but do not have, so you kill. You covet but you cannot get what you 
want, so you quarrel and fight. You do not have because you do not ask God.
	 --James 4:2
%
When you ask, you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, that you 
may spend what you get on your pleasures.
	 --James 4:3
%
You adulterous people, don’t you know that friendship with the world means 
enmity against God? Therefore, anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world 
becomes an enemy of God.
	 --James 4:4
%
Or do you think Scripture says without reason that he jealously longs for the 
spirit he has caused to dwell in us?
	 --James 4:5
%
But he gives us more grace. That is why Scripture says: “God opposes the 
proud but shows favor to the humble.”
	 --James 4:6
%
Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
	 --James 4:7
%
Come near to God and he will come near to you. Wash your hands, you sinners, 
and purify your hearts, you double-minded.
	 --James 4:8
%
Grieve, mourn and wail. Change your laughter to mourning and your joy to gloom.
	 --James 4:9
%
Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up.
	 --James 4:10
%
Brothers and sisters, do not slander one another. Anyone who speaks against a 
brother or sister or judges them speaks against the law and judges it. When you 
judge the law, you are not keeping it, but sitting in judgment on it.
	 --James 4:11
%
There is only one Lawgiver and Judge, the one who is able to save and destroy. 
But you—who are you to judge your neighbor?
	 --James 4:12
%
Now listen, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city, 
spend a year there, carry on business and make money.”
	 --James 4:13
%
Why, you do not even know what will happen tomorrow. What is your life? You are 
a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.
	 --James 4:14
%
Instead, you ought to say, “If it is the Lord’s will, we will live and do 
this or that.”
	 --James 4:15
%
As it is, you boast in your arrogant schemes. All such boasting is evil.
	 --James 4:16
%
If anyone, then, knows the good they ought to do and doesn’t do it, it is sin 
for them.
	 --James 4:17
%
Now listen, you rich people, weep and wail because of the misery that is coming 
on you.
	 --James 5:1
%
Your wealth has rotted, and moths have eaten your clothes.
	 --James 5:2
%
Your gold and silver are corroded. Their corrosion will testify against you and 
eat your flesh like fire. You have hoarded wealth in the last days.
	 --James 5:3
%
Look! The wages you failed to pay the workers who mowed your fields are crying 
out against you. The cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord 
Almighty.
	 --James 5:4
%
You have lived on earth in luxury and self-indulgence. You have fattened 
yourselves in the day of slaughter.
	 --James 5:5
%
You have condemned and murdered the innocent one, who was not opposing you.
	 --James 5:6
%
Be patient, then, brothers and sisters, until the Lord’s coming. See how the 
farmer waits for the land to yield its valuable crop, patiently waiting for the 
autumn and spring rains.
	 --James 5:7
%
You too, be patient and stand firm, because the Lord’s coming is near.
	 --James 5:8
%
Don’t grumble against one another, brothers and sisters, or you will be 
judged. The Judge is standing at the door!
	 --James 5:9
%
Brothers and sisters, as an example of patience in the face of suffering, take 
the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.
	 --James 5:10
%
As you know, we count as blessed those who have persevered. You have heard of 
Job’s perseverance and have seen what the Lord finally brought about. The 
Lord is full of compassion and mercy.
	 --James 5:11
%
Above all, my brothers and sisters, do not swear—not by heaven or by earth or 
by anything else. All you need to say is a simple “Yes” or “No.” 
Otherwise you will be condemned.
	 --James 5:12
%
Is anyone among you in trouble? Let them pray. Is anyone happy? Let them sing 
songs of praise.
	 --James 5:13
%
Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over 
them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord.
	 --James 5:14
%
And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will 
raise them up. If they have sinned, they will be forgiven.
	 --James 5:15
%
Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you 
may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.
	 --James 5:16
%
Elijah was a human being, even as we are. He prayed earnestly that it would not 
rain, and it did not rain on the land for three and a half years.
	 --James 5:17
%
Again he prayed, and the heavens gave rain, and the earth produced its crops.
	 --James 5:18
%
My brothers and sisters, if one of you should wander from the truth and someone 
should bring that person back,
	 --James 5:19
%
remember this: Whoever turns a sinner from the error of their way will save 
them from death and cover over a multitude of sins.
	 --James 5:20
%In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
	--John 1:1
%
He was with God in the beginning.
	--John 1:2
%
Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been 
made.
	--John 1:3
%
In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind.
	--John 1:4
%
The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.
	--John 1:5
%
There was a man sent from God whose name was John.
	--John 1:6
%
He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all 
might believe.
	--John 1:7
%
He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light.
	--John 1:8
%
The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world.
	--John 1:9
%
He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did 
not recognize him.
	--John 1:10
%
He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him.
	--John 1:11
%
Yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the 
right to become children of God—
	--John 1:12
%
children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband’s 
will, but born of God.
	--John 1:13
%
The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, 
the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and 
truth.
	--John 1:14
%
(John testified concerning him. He cried out, saying, “This is the one I 
spoke about when I said, ‘He who comes after me has surpassed me because he 
was before me.’”)
	--John 1:15
%
Out of his fullness we have all received grace in place of grace already given.
	--John 1:16
%
For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.
	--John 1:17
%
No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is himself God and is 
in closest relationship with the Father, has made him known.
	--John 1:18
%
Now this was John’s testimony when the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem sent 
priests and Levites to ask him who he was.
	--John 1:19
%
He did not fail to confess, but confessed freely, “I am not the Messiah.”
	--John 1:20
%
They asked him, “Then who are you? Are you Elijah?” He said, “I am 
not.” “Are you the Prophet?” He answered, “No.”
	--John 1:21
%
Finally they said, “Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who 
sent us. What do you say about yourself?”
	--John 1:22
%
John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, “I am the voice of one 
calling in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way for the Lord.’”
	--John 1:23
%
Now the Pharisees who had been sent
	--John 1:24
%
questioned him, “Why then do you baptize if you are not the Messiah, nor 
Elijah, nor the Prophet?”
	--John 1:25
%
“I baptize with water,” John replied, “but among you stands one you do 
not know.
	--John 1:26
%
He is the one who comes after me, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy 
to untie.”
	--John 1:27
%
This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was 
baptizing.
	--John 1:28
%
The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, “Look, the Lamb of 
God, who takes away the sin of the world!
	--John 1:29
%
This is the one I meant when I said, ‘A man who comes after me has surpassed 
me because he was before me.’
	--John 1:30
%
I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that 
he might be revealed to Israel.”
	--John 1:31
%
Then John gave this testimony: “I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a 
dove and remain on him.
	--John 1:32
%
And I myself did not know him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water 
told me, ‘The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is the one 
who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.’
	--John 1:33
%
I have seen and I testify that this is God’s Chosen One.”
	--John 1:34
%
The next day John was there again with two of his disciples.
	--John 1:35
%
When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, “Look, the Lamb of God!”
	--John 1:36
%
When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus.
	--John 1:37
%
Turning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, “What do you want?” 
They said, “Rabbi” (which means “Teacher”), “where are you staying?”
	--John 1:38
%
“Come,” he replied, “and you will see.” So they went and saw where he 
was staying, and they spent that day with him. It was about four in the 
afternoon.
	--John 1:39
%
Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, was one of the two who heard what John had 
said and who had followed Jesus.
	--John 1:40
%
The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, “We 
have found the Messiah” (that is, the Christ).
	--John 1:41
%
And he brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, “You are Simon son 
of John. You will be called Cephas” (which, when translated, is Peter).
	--John 1:42
%
The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. Finding Philip, he said to 
him, “Follow me.”
	--John 1:43
%
Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida.
	--John 1:44
%
Philip found Nathanael and told him, “We have found the one Moses wrote about 
in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote—Jesus of Nazareth, the son 
of Joseph.”
	--John 1:45
%
“Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?” Nathanael asked. “Come and 
see,” said Philip.
	--John 1:46
%
When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said of him, “Here truly is an 
Israelite in whom there is no deceit.”
	--John 1:47
%
“How do you know me?” Nathanael asked. Jesus answered, “I saw you while 
you were still under the fig tree before Philip called you.”
	--John 1:48
%
Then Nathanael declared, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the king of 
Israel.”
	--John 1:49
%
Jesus said, “You believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree. You 
will see greater things than that.”
	--John 1:50
%
He then added, “Very truly I tell you, you will see ‘heaven open, and the 
angels of God ascending and descending on’ the Son of Man.”
	--John 1:51
%
On the third day a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus’ mother was 
there,
	--John 2:1
%
and Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding.
	--John 2:2
%
When the wine was gone, Jesus’ mother said to him, “They have no more 
wine.”
	--John 2:3
%
“Woman, why do you involve me?” Jesus replied. “My hour has not yet 
come.”
	--John 2:4
%
His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.”
	--John 2:5
%
Nearby stood six stone water jars, the kind used by the Jews for ceremonial 
washing, each holding from twenty to thirty gallons.
	--John 2:6
%
Jesus said to the servants, “Fill the jars with water”; so they filled them 
to the brim.
	--John 2:7
%
Then he told them, “Now draw some out and take it to the master of the 
banquet.” They did so,
	--John 2:8
%
and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine. 
He did not realize where it had come from, though the servants who had drawn 
the water knew. Then he called the bridegroom aside
	--John 2:9
%
and said, “Everyone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper 
wine after the guests have had too much to drink; but you have saved the best 
till now.”
	--John 2:10
%
What Jesus did here in Cana of Galilee was the first of the signs through which 
he revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him.
	--John 2:11
%
After this he went down to Capernaum with his mother and brothers and his 
disciples. There they stayed for a few days.
	--John 2:12
%
When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
	--John 2:13
%
In the temple courts he found people selling cattle, sheep and doves, and 
others sitting at tables exchanging money.
	--John 2:14
%
So he made a whip out of cords, and drove all from the temple courts, both 
sheep and cattle; he scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned 
their tables.
	--John 2:15
%
To those who sold doves he said, “Get these out of here! Stop turning my 
Father’s house into a market!”
	--John 2:16
%
His disciples remembered that it is written: “Zeal for your house will 
consume me.”
	--John 2:17
%
The Jews then responded to him, “What sign can you show us to prove your 
authority to do all this?”
	--John 2:18
%
Jesus answered them, “Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three 
days.”
	--John 2:19
%
They replied, “It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and you are 
going to raise it in three days?”
	--John 2:20
%
But the temple he had spoken of was his body.
	--John 2:21
%
After he was raised from the dead, his disciples recalled what he had said. 
Then they believed the scripture and the words that Jesus had spoken.
	--John 2:22
%
Now while he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Festival, many people saw the 
signs he was performing and believed in his name.
	--John 2:23
%
But Jesus would not entrust himself to them, for he knew all people.
	--John 2:24
%
He did not need any testimony about mankind, for he knew what was in each 
person.
	--John 2:25
%
Now there was a Pharisee, a man named Nicodemus who was a member of the Jewish 
ruling council.
	--John 3:1
%
He came to Jesus at night and said, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher 
who has come from God. For no one could perform the signs you are doing if God 
were not with him.”
	--John 3:2
%
Jesus replied, “Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God 
unless they are born again.”

“How can someone be born when they are old?” Nicodemus asked. “Surely 
they cannot enter a second time into their mother’s womb to be born!”
	--John 3:4
%
Jesus answered, “Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God 
unless they are born of water and the Spirit.
	--John 3:5
%
Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit.
	--John 3:6
%
You should not be surprised at my saying, ‘You must be born again.’
	--John 3:7
%
The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell 
where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the 
Spirit.”
	--John 3:8
%
“How can this be?” Nicodemus asked.
	--John 3:9
%
“You are Israel’s teacher,” said Jesus, “and do you not understand 
these things?
	--John 3:10
%
Very truly I tell you, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have 
seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony.
	--John 3:11
%
I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will 
you believe if I speak of heavenly things?
	--John 3:12
%
No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven—the Son 
of Man.
	--John 3:13
%
Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be 
lifted up,
	--John 3:14
%
that everyone who believes may have eternal life in him.”
	--John 3:15
%
For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever 
believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.
	--John 3:16
%
For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save 
the world through him.
	--John 3:17
%
Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands 
condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and 
only Son.
	--John 3:18
%
This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness 
instead of light because their deeds were evil.
	--John 3:19
%
Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for 
fear that their deeds will be exposed.
	--John 3:20
%
But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen 
plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of God.
	--John 3:21
%
After this, Jesus and his disciples went out into the Judean countryside, where 
he spent some time with them, and baptized.
	--John 3:22
%
Now John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of 
water, and people were coming and being baptized.
	--John 3:23
%
(This was before John was put in prison.)
	--John 3:24
%
An argument developed between some of John’s disciples and a certain Jew over 
the matter of ceremonial washing.
	--John 3:25
%
They came to John and said to him, “Rabbi, that man who was with you on the 
other side of the Jordan—the one you testified about—look, he is baptizing, 
and everyone is going to him.”
	--John 3:26
%
To this John replied, “A person can receive only what is given them from 
heaven.
	--John 3:27
%
You yourselves can testify that I said, ‘I am not the Messiah but am sent 
ahead of him.’
	--John 3:28
%
The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend who attends the bridegroom 
waits and listens for him, and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom’s 
voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete.
	--John 3:29
%
He must become greater; I must become less.”
	--John 3:30
%
The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth 
belongs to the earth, and speaks as one from the earth. The one who comes from 
heaven is above all.
	--John 3:31
%
He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony.
	--John 3:32
%
Whoever has accepted it has certified that God is truthful.
	--John 3:33
%
For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit 
without limit.
	--John 3:34
%
The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands.
	--John 3:35
%
Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will 
not see life, for God’s wrath remains on them.
	--John 3:36
%
Now Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard that he was gaining and 
baptizing more disciples than John—
	--John 4:1
%
although in fact it was not Jesus who baptized, but his disciples.
	--John 4:2
%
So he left Judea and went back once more to Galilee.
	--John 4:3
%
Now he had to go through Samaria.
	--John 4:4
%
So he came to a town in Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of ground Jacob 
had given to his son Joseph.
	--John 4:5
%
Jacob’s well was there, and Jesus, tired as he was from the journey, sat down 
by the well. It was about noon.
	--John 4:6
%
When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, “Will you give 
me a drink?”
	--John 4:7
%
(His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.)
	--John 4:8
%
The Samaritan woman said to him, “You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman. 
How can you ask me for a drink?” (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.)
	--John 4:9
%
Jesus answered her, “If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you 
for a drink, you would have asked him and he would have given you living 
water.”
	--John 4:10
%
“Sir,” the woman said, “you have nothing to draw with and the well is 
deep. Where can you get this living water?
	--John 4:11
%
Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it 
himself, as did also his sons and his livestock?”
	--John 4:12
%
Jesus answered, “Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again,
	--John 4:13
%
but whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst. Indeed, the water I 
give them will become in them a spring of water welling up to eternal life.”
	--John 4:14
%
The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water so that I won’t get thirsty 
and have to keep coming here to draw water.”
	--John 4:15
%
He told her, “Go, call your husband and come back.”
	--John 4:16
%
“I have no husband,” she replied. Jesus said to her, “You are right when 
you say you have no husband.
	--John 4:17
%
The fact is, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your 
husband. What you have just said is quite true.”
	--John 4:18
%
“Sir,” the woman said, “I can see that you are a prophet.
	--John 4:19
%
Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that the place 
where we must worship is in Jerusalem.”
	--John 4:20
%
“Woman,” Jesus replied, “believe me, a time is coming when you will 
worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.
	--John 4:21
%
You Samaritans worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, for 
salvation is from the Jews.
	--John 4:22
%
Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the 
Father in the Spirit and in truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the 
Father seeks.
	--John 4:23
%
God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in truth.”
	--John 4:24
%
The woman said, “I know that Messiah” (called Christ) “is coming. When he 
comes, he will explain everything to us.”
	--John 4:25
%
Then Jesus declared, “I, the one speaking to you—I am he.”
	--John 4:26
%
Just then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a 
woman. But no one asked, “What do you want?” or “Why are you talking with 
her?”
	--John 4:27
%
Then, leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the 
people,
	--John 4:28
%
“Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the 
Messiah?”
	--John 4:29
%
They came out of the town and made their way toward him.
	--John 4:30
%
Meanwhile his disciples urged him, “Rabbi, eat something.”
	--John 4:31
%
But he said to them, “I have food to eat that you know nothing about.”
	--John 4:32
%
Then his disciples said to each other, “Could someone have brought him 
food?”
	--John 4:33
%
“My food,” said Jesus, “is to do the will of him who sent me and to 
finish his work.
	--John 4:34
%
Don’t you have a saying, ‘It’s still four months until harvest’? I tell 
you, open your eyes and look at the fields! They are ripe for harvest.
	--John 4:35
%
Even now the one who reaps draws a wage and harvests a crop for eternal life, 
so that the sower and the reaper may be glad together.
	--John 4:36
%
Thus the saying ‘One sows and another reaps’ is true.
	--John 4:37
%
I sent you to reap what you have not worked for. Others have done the hard 
work, and you have reaped the benefits of their labor.”
	--John 4:38
%
Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman’s 
testimony, “He told me everything I ever did.”
	--John 4:39
%
So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he 
stayed two days.
	--John 4:40
%
And because of his words many more became believers.
	--John 4:41
%
They said to the woman, “We no longer believe just because of what you said; 
now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Savior 
of the world.”
	--John 4:42
%
After the two days he left for Galilee.
	--John 4:43
%
(Now Jesus himself had pointed out that a prophet has no honor in his own 
country.)
	--John 4:44
%
When he arrived in Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him. They had seen all that 
he had done in Jerusalem at the Passover Festival, for they also had been there.
	--John 4:45
%
Once more he visited Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. 
And there was a certain royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum.
	--John 4:46
%
When this man heard that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judea, he went to 
him and begged him to come and heal his son, who was close to death.
	--John 4:47
%
“Unless you people see signs and wonders,” Jesus told him, “you will 
never believe.”
	--John 4:48
%
The royal official said, “Sir, come down before my child dies.”
	--John 4:49
%
“Go,” Jesus replied, “your son will live.” The man took Jesus at his 
word and departed.
	--John 4:50
%
While he was still on the way, his servants met him with the news that his boy 
was living.
	--John 4:51
%
When he inquired as to the time when his son got better, they said to him, 
“Yesterday, at one in the afternoon, the fever left him.”
	--John 4:52
%
Then the father realized that this was the exact time at which Jesus had said 
to him, “Your son will live.” So he and his whole household believed.
	--John 4:53
%
This was the second sign Jesus performed after coming from Judea to Galilee.
	--John 4:54
%
Some time later, Jesus went up to Jerusalem for one of the Jewish festivals.
	--John 5:1
%
Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool, which in Aramaic is 
called Bethesda and which is surrounded by five covered colonnades.
	--John 5:2
%
Here a great number of disabled people used to lie—the blind, the lame, the 
paralyzed.
	--John 5:3
%

	--John 5:4
%
One who was there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years.
	--John 5:5
%
When Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition 
for a long time, he asked him, “Do you want to get well?”
	--John 5:6
%
“Sir,” the invalid replied, “I have no one to help me into the pool when 
the water is stirred. While I am trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead 
of me.”
	--John 5:7
%
Then Jesus said to him, “Get up! Pick up your mat and walk.”
	--John 5:8
%
At once the man was cured; he picked up his mat and walked. The day on which 
this took place was a Sabbath,
	--John 5:9
%
and so the Jewish leaders said to the man who had been healed, “It is the 
Sabbath; the law forbids you to carry your mat.”
	--John 5:10
%
But he replied, “The man who made me well said to me, ‘Pick up your mat and 
walk.’ ”
	--John 5:11
%
So they asked him, “Who is this fellow who told you to pick it up and walk?”
	--John 5:12
%
The man who was healed had no idea who it was, for Jesus had slipped away into 
the crowd that was there.
	--John 5:13
%
Later Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, “See, you are well 
again. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you.”
	--John 5:14
%
The man went away and told the Jewish leaders that it was Jesus who had made 
him well.
	--John 5:15
%
So, because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jewish leaders 
began to persecute him.
	--John 5:16
%
In his defense Jesus said to them, “My Father is always at his work to this 
very day, and I too am working.”
	--John 5:17
%
For this reason they tried all the more to kill him; not only was he breaking 
the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal 
with God.
	--John 5:18
%
Jesus gave them this answer: “Very truly I tell you, the Son can do nothing 
by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the 
Father does the Son also does.
	--John 5:19
%
For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does. Yes, and he will show 
him even greater works than these, so that you will be amazed.
	--John 5:20
%
For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son 
gives life to whom he is pleased to give it.
	--John 5:21
%
Moreover, the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son,
	--John 5:22
%
that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not 
honor the Son does not honor the Father, who sent him.
	--John 5:23
%
“Very truly I tell you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me 
has eternal life and will not be judged but has crossed over from death to life.
	--John 5:24
%
Very truly I tell you, a time is coming and has now come when the dead will 
hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live.
	--John 5:25
%
For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have 
life in himself.
	--John 5:26
%
And he has given him authority to judge because he is the Son of Man.
	--John 5:27
%
“Do not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their 
graves will hear his voice
	--John 5:28
%
and come out—those who have done what is good will rise to live, and those 
who have done what is evil will rise to be condemned.
	--John 5:29
%
By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, 
for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me.
	--John 5:30
%
“If I testify about myself, my testimony is not true.
	--John 5:31
%
There is another who testifies in my favor, and I know that his testimony about 
me is true.
	--John 5:32
%
“You have sent to John and he has testified to the truth.
	--John 5:33
%
Not that I accept human testimony; but I mention it that you may be saved.
	--John 5:34
%
John was a lamp that burned and gave light, and you chose for a time to enjoy 
his light.
	--John 5:35
%
“I have testimony weightier than that of John. For the works that the Father 
has given me to finish—the very works that I am doing—testify that the 
Father has sent me.
	--John 5:36
%
And the Father who sent me has himself testified concerning me. You have never 
heard his voice nor seen his form,
	--John 5:37
%
nor does his word dwell in you, for you do not believe the one he sent.
	--John 5:38
%
You study the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have 
eternal life. These are the very Scriptures that testify about me,
	--John 5:39
%
yet you refuse to come to me to have life.
	--John 5:40
%
“I do not accept glory from human beings,
	--John 5:41
%
but I know you. I know that you do not have the love of God in your hearts.
	--John 5:42
%
I have come in my Father’s name, and you do not accept me; but if someone 
else comes in his own name, you will accept him.
	--John 5:43
%
How can you believe since you accept glory from one another but do not seek the 
glory that comes from the only God?
	--John 5:44
%
“But do not think I will accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses, 
on whom your hopes are set.
	--John 5:45
%
If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me.
	--John 5:46
%
But since you do not believe what he wrote, how are you going to believe what I 
say?”
	--John 5:47
%
Some time after this, Jesus crossed to the far shore of the Sea of Galilee 
(that is, the Sea of Tiberias),
	--John 6:1
%
and a great crowd of people followed him because they saw the signs he had 
performed by healing the sick.
	--John 6:2
%
Then Jesus went up on a mountainside and sat down with his disciples.
	--John 6:3
%
The Jewish Passover Festival was near.
	--John 6:4
%
When Jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming toward him, he said to 
Philip, “Where shall we buy bread for these people to eat?”
	--John 6:5
%
He asked this only to test him, for he already had in mind what he was going to 
do.
	--John 6:6
%
Philip answered him, “It would take more than half a year’s wages to buy 
enough bread for each one to have a bite!”
	--John 6:7
%
Another of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, spoke up,
	--John 6:8
%
“Here is a boy with five small barley loaves and two small fish, but how far 
will they go among so many?”
	--John 6:9
%
Jesus said, “Have the people sit down.” There was plenty of grass in that 
place, and they sat down (about five thousand men were there).
	--John 6:10
%
Jesus then took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed to those who were 
seated as much as they wanted. He did the same with the fish.
	--John 6:11
%
When they had all had enough to eat, he said to his disciples, “Gather the 
pieces that are left over. Let nothing be wasted.”
	--John 6:12
%
So they gathered them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five 
barley loaves left over by those who had eaten.
	--John 6:13
%
After the people saw the sign Jesus performed, they began to say, “Surely 
this is the Prophet who is to come into the world.”
	--John 6:14
%
Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and make him king by force, withdrew 
again to a mountain by himself.
	--John 6:15
%
When evening came, his disciples went down to the lake,
	--John 6:16
%
where they got into a boat and set off across the lake for Capernaum. By now it 
was dark, and Jesus had not yet joined them.
	--John 6:17
%
A strong wind was blowing and the waters grew rough.
	--John 6:18
%
When they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus approaching the 
boat, walking on the water; and they were frightened.
	--John 6:19
%
But he said to them, “It is I; don’t be afraid.”
	--John 6:20
%
Then they were willing to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat 
reached the shore where they were heading.
	--John 6:21
%
The next day the crowd that had stayed on the opposite shore of the lake 
realized that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not entered it 
with his disciples, but that they had gone away alone.
	--John 6:22
%
Then some boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the people had eaten 
the bread after the Lord had given thanks.
	--John 6:23
%
Once the crowd realized that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they 
got into the boats and went to Capernaum in search of Jesus.
	--John 6:24
%
When they found him on the other side of the lake, they asked him, “Rabbi, 
when did you get here?”
	--John 6:25
%
Jesus answered, “Very truly I tell you, you are looking for me, not because 
you saw the signs I performed but because you ate the loaves and had your fill.
	--John 6:26
%
Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, 
which the Son of Man will give you. For on him God the Father has placed his 
seal of approval.”
	--John 6:27
%
Then they asked him, “What must we do to do the works God requires?”
	--John 6:28
%
Jesus answered, “The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has 
sent.”
	--John 6:29
%
So they asked him, “What sign then will you give that we may see it and 
believe you? What will you do?
	--John 6:30
%
Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written: ‘He gave 
them bread from heaven to eat.’”
	--John 6:31
%
Jesus said to them, “Very truly I tell you, it is not Moses who has given you 
the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from 
heaven.
	--John 6:32
%
For the bread of God is the bread that comes down from heaven and gives life to 
the world.”
	--John 6:33
%
“Sir,” they said, “always give us this bread.”
	--John 6:34
%
Then Jesus declared, “I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never 
go hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.
	--John 6:35
%
But as I told you, you have seen me and still you do not believe.
	--John 6:36
%
All those the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will 
never drive away.
	--John 6:37
%
For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him 
who sent me.
	--John 6:38
%
And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all those he 
has given me, but raise them up at the last day.
	--John 6:39
%
For my Father’s will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in 
him shall have eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day.”
	--John 6:40
%
At this the Jews there began to grumble about him because he said, “I am the 
bread that came down from heaven.”
	--John 6:41
%
They said, “Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we 
know? How can he now say, ‘I came down from heaven’?”
	--John 6:42
%
“Stop grumbling among yourselves,” Jesus answered.
	--John 6:43
%
“No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws them, and I will 
raise them up at the last day.
	--John 6:44
%
It is written in the Prophets: ‘They will all be taught by God.’ Everyone 
who has heard the Father and learned from him comes to me.
	--John 6:45
%
No one has seen the Father except the one who is from God; only he has seen the 
Father.
	--John 6:46
%
Very truly I tell you, the one who believes has eternal life.
	--John 6:47
%
I am the bread of life.
	--John 6:48
%
Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness, yet they died.
	--John 6:49
%
But here is the bread that comes down from heaven, which anyone may eat and not 
die.
	--John 6:50
%
I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats this bread will 
live forever. This bread is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the 
world.”
	--John 6:51
%
Then the Jews began to argue sharply among themselves, “How can this man give 
us his flesh to eat?”
	--John 6:52
%
Jesus said to them, “Very truly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the 
Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.
	--John 6:53
%
Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise 
them up at the last day.
	--John 6:54
%
For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink.
	--John 6:55
%
Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in them.
	--John 6:56
%
Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one 
who feeds on me will live because of me.
	--John 6:57
%
This is the bread that came down from heaven. Your ancestors ate manna and 
died, but whoever feeds on this bread will live forever.”
	--John 6:58
%
He said this while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.
	--John 6:59
%
On hearing it, many of his disciples said, “This is a hard teaching. Who can 
accept it?”
	--John 6:60
%
Aware that his disciples were grumbling about this, Jesus said to them, “Does 
this offend you?
	--John 6:61
%
Then what if you see the Son of Man ascend to where he was before!
	--John 6:62
%
The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to 
you—they are full of the Spirit and life.
	--John 6:63
%
Yet there are some of you who do not believe.” For Jesus had known from the 
beginning which of them did not believe and who would betray him.
	--John 6:64
%
He went on to say, “This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless 
the Father has enabled them.”
	--John 6:65
%
From this time many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him.
	--John 6:66
%
“You do not want to leave too, do you?” Jesus asked the Twelve.
	--John 6:67
%
Simon Peter answered him, “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of 
eternal life.
	--John 6:68
%
We have come to believe and to know that you are the Holy One of God.”
	--John 6:69
%
Then Jesus replied, “Have I not chosen you, the Twelve? Yet one of you is a 
devil!”
	--John 6:70
%
(He meant Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, who, though one of the Twelve, was 
later to betray him.)
	--John 6:71
%
After this, Jesus went around in Galilee. He did not want to go about in Judea 
because the Jewish leaders there were looking for a way to kill him.
	--John 7:1
%
But when the Jewish Festival of Tabernacles was near,
	--John 7:2
%
Jesus’ brothers said to him, “Leave Galilee and go to Judea, so that your 
disciples there may see the works you do.
	--John 7:3
%
No one who wants to become a public figure acts in secret. Since you are doing 
these things, show yourself to the world.”
	--John 7:4
%
For even his own brothers did not believe in him.
	--John 7:5
%
Therefore Jesus told them, “My time is not yet here; for you any time will do.
	--John 7:6
%
The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify that its works are 
evil.
	--John 7:7
%
You go to the festival. I am not going up to this festival, because my time has 
not yet fully come.”
	--John 7:8
%
After he had said this, he stayed in Galilee.
	--John 7:9
%
However, after his brothers had left for the festival, he went also, not 
publicly, but in secret.
	--John 7:10
%
Now at the festival the Jewish leaders were watching for Jesus and asking, 
“Where is he?”
	--John 7:11
%
Among the crowds there was widespread whispering about him. Some said, “He is 
a good man.” Others replied, “No, he deceives the people.”
	--John 7:12
%
But no one would say anything publicly about him for fear of the leaders.
	--John 7:13
%
Not until halfway through the festival did Jesus go up to the temple courts and 
begin to teach.
	--John 7:14
%
The Jews there were amazed and asked, “How did this man get such learning 
without having been taught?”
	--John 7:15
%
Jesus answered, “My teaching is not my own. It comes from the one who sent me.
	--John 7:16
%
Anyone who chooses to do the will of God will find out whether my teaching 
comes from God or whether I speak on my own.
	--John 7:17
%
Whoever speaks on their own does so to gain personal glory, but he who seeks 
the glory of the one who sent him is a man of truth; there is nothing false 
about him.
	--John 7:18
%
Has not Moses given you the law? Yet not one of you keeps the law. Why are you 
trying to kill me?”
	--John 7:19
%
“You are demon-possessed,” the crowd answered. “Who is trying to kill 
you?”
	--John 7:20
%
Jesus said to them, “I did one miracle, and you are all amazed.
	--John 7:21
%
Yet, because Moses gave you circumcision (though actually it did not come from 
Moses, but from the patriarchs), you circumcise a boy on the Sabbath.
	--John 7:22
%
Now if a boy can be circumcised on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses may not 
be broken, why are you angry with me for healing a man’s whole body on the 
Sabbath?
	--John 7:23
%
Stop judging by mere appearances, but instead judge correctly.”
	--John 7:24
%
At that point some of the people of Jerusalem began to ask, “Isn’t this the 
man they are trying to kill?
	--John 7:25
%
Here he is, speaking publicly, and they are not saying a word to him. Have the 
authorities really concluded that he is the Messiah?
	--John 7:26
%
But we know where this man is from; when the Messiah comes, no one will know 
where he is from.”
	--John 7:27
%
Then Jesus, still teaching in the temple courts, cried out, “Yes, you know 
me, and you know where I am from. I am not here on my own authority, but he who 
sent me is true. You do not know him,
	--John 7:28
%
but I know him because I am from him and he sent me.”
	--John 7:29
%
At this they tried to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him, because his 
hour had not yet come.
	--John 7:30
%
Still, many in the crowd believed in him. They said, “When the Messiah comes, 
will he perform more signs than this man?”
	--John 7:31
%
The Pharisees heard the crowd whispering such things about him. Then the chief 
priests and the Pharisees sent temple guards to arrest him.
	--John 7:32
%
Jesus said, “I am with you for only a short time, and then I am going to the 
one who sent me.
	--John 7:33
%
You will look for me, but you will not find me; and where I am, you cannot 
come.”
	--John 7:34
%
The Jews said to one another, “Where does this man intend to go that we 
cannot find him? Will he go where our people live scattered among the Greeks, 
and teach the Greeks?
	--John 7:35
%
What did he mean when he said, ‘You will look for me, but you will not find 
me,’ and ‘Where I am, you cannot come’?”
	--John 7:36
%
On the last and greatest day of the festival, Jesus stood and said in a loud 
voice, “Let anyone who is thirsty come to me and drink.
	--John 7:37
%
Whoever believes in me, as Scripture has said, rivers of living water will flow 
from within them.”
	--John 7:38
%
By this he meant the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were later to 
receive. Up to that time the Spirit had not been given, since Jesus had not yet 
been glorified.
	--John 7:39
%
On hearing his words, some of the people said, “Surely this man is the 
Prophet.”
	--John 7:40
%
Others said, “He is the Messiah.” Still others asked, “How can the 
Messiah come from Galilee?
	--John 7:41
%
Does not Scripture say that the Messiah will come from David’s descendants 
and from Bethlehem, the town where David lived?”
	--John 7:42
%
Thus the people were divided because of Jesus.
	--John 7:43
%
Some wanted to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him.
	--John 7:44
%
Finally the temple guards went back to the chief priests and the Pharisees, who 
asked them, “Why didn’t you bring him in?”
	--John 7:45
%
“No one ever spoke the way this man does,” the guards replied.
	--John 7:46
%
“You mean he has deceived you also?” the Pharisees retorted.
	--John 7:47
%
“Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed in him?
	--John 7:48
%
No! But this mob that knows nothing of the law—there is a curse on them.”
	--John 7:49
%
Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus earlier and who was one of their own number, 
asked,
	--John 7:50
%
“Does our law condemn a man without first hearing him to find out what he has 
been doing?”
	--John 7:51
%
They replied, “Are you from Galilee, too? Look into it, and you will find 
that a prophet does not come out of Galilee.”
	--John 7:52
%
[The earliest manuscripts and many other ancient witnesses do not have John 
7:53—8:11. A few manuscripts include these verses, wholly or in part, after 
John 7:36, John 21:25, Luke 21:38 or Luke 24:53.] Then they all went home,
	--John 7:53
%
8 but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
	--John 8:1
%
At dawn he appeared again in the temple courts, where all the people gathered 
around him, and he sat down to teach them.
	--John 8:2
%
The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in 
adultery. They made her stand before the group
	--John 8:3
%
and said to Jesus, “Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery.
	--John 8:4
%
In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?”
	--John 8:5
%
They were using this question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing 
him. But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger.
	--John 8:6
%
When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, “Let 
any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.”
	--John 8:7
%
Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground.
	--John 8:8
%
At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, 
until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there.
	--John 8:9
%
Jesus straightened up and asked her, “Woman, where are they? Has no one 
condemned you?”
	--John 8:10
%
“No one, sir,” she said. “Then neither do I condemn you,” Jesus 
declared. “Go now and leave your life of sin.”
	--John 8:11
%
When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, “I am the light of the world. 
Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of 
life.”
	--John 8:12
%
The Pharisees challenged him, “Here you are, appearing as your own witness; 
your testimony is not valid.”
	--John 8:13
%
Jesus answered, “Even if I testify on my own behalf, my testimony is valid, 
for I know where I came from and where I am going. But you have no idea where I 
come from or where I am going.
	--John 8:14
%
You judge by human standards; I pass judgment on no one.
	--John 8:15
%
But if I do judge, my decisions are true, because I am not alone. I stand with 
the Father, who sent me.
	--John 8:16
%
In your own Law it is written that the testimony of two witnesses is true.
	--John 8:17
%
I am one who testifies for myself; my other witness is the Father, who sent 
me.”
	--John 8:18
%
Then they asked him, “Where is your father?” “You do not know me or my 
Father,” Jesus replied. “If you knew me, you would know my Father also.”
	--John 8:19
%
He spoke these words while teaching in the temple courts near the place where 
the offerings were put. Yet no one seized him, because his hour had not yet 
come.
	--John 8:20
%
Once more Jesus said to them, “I am going away, and you will look for me, and 
you will die in your sin. Where I go, you cannot come.”
	--John 8:21
%
This made the Jews ask, “Will he kill himself? Is that why he says, ‘Where 
I go, you cannot come’?”
	--John 8:22
%
But he continued, “You are from below; I am from above. You are of this 
world; I am not of this world.
	--John 8:23
%
I told you that you would die in your sins; if you do not believe that I am he, 
you will indeed die in your sins.”
	--John 8:24
%
“Who are you?” they asked. “Just what I have been telling you from the 
beginning,” Jesus replied.
	--John 8:25
%
“I have much to say in judgment of you. But he who sent me is trustworthy, 
and what I have heard from him I tell the world.”
	--John 8:26
%
They did not understand that he was telling them about his Father.
	--John 8:27
%
So Jesus said, “When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know 
that I am he and that I do nothing on my own but speak just what the Father has 
taught me.
	--John 8:28
%
The one who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, for I always do what 
pleases him.”
	--John 8:29
%
Even as he spoke, many believed in him.
	--John 8:30
%
To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, “If you hold to my teaching, 
you are really my disciples.
	--John 8:31
%
Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”
	--John 8:32
%
They answered him, “We are Abraham’s descendants and have never been slaves 
of anyone. How can you say that we shall be set free?”
	--John 8:33
%
Jesus replied, “Very truly I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin.
	--John 8:34
%
Now a slave has no permanent place in the family, but a son belongs to it 
forever.
	--John 8:35
%
So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.
	--John 8:36
%
I know that you are Abraham’s descendants. Yet you are looking for a way to 
kill me, because you have no room for my word.
	--John 8:37
%
I am telling you what I have seen in the Father’s presence, and you are doing 
what you have heard from your father.”
	--John 8:38
%
“Abraham is our father,” they answered. “If you were Abraham’s 
children,” said Jesus, “then you would do what Abraham did.
	--John 8:39
%
As it is, you are looking for a way to kill me, a man who has told you the 
truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do such things.
	--John 8:40
%
You are doing the works of your own father.” “We are not illegitimate 
children,” they protested. “The only Father we have is God himself.”
	--John 8:41
%
Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father, you would love me, for I have 
come here from God. I have not come on my own; God sent me.
	--John 8:42
%
Why is my language not clear to you? Because you are unable to hear what I say.
	--John 8:43
%
You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father’s 
desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for 
there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he 
is a liar and the father of lies.
	--John 8:44
%
Yet because I tell the truth, you do not believe me!
	--John 8:45
%
Can any of you prove me guilty of sin? If I am telling the truth, why don’t 
you believe me?
	--John 8:46
%
Whoever belongs to God hears what God says. The reason you do not hear is that 
you do not belong to God.”
	--John 8:47
%
The Jews answered him, “Aren’t we right in saying that you are a Samaritan 
and demon-possessed?”
	--John 8:48
%
“I am not possessed by a demon,” said Jesus, “but I honor my Father and 
you dishonor me.
	--John 8:49
%
I am not seeking glory for myself; but there is one who seeks it, and he is the 
judge.
	--John 8:50
%
Very truly I tell you, whoever obeys my word will never see death.”
	--John 8:51
%
At this they exclaimed, “Now we know that you are demon-possessed! Abraham 
died and so did the prophets, yet you say that whoever obeys your word will 
never taste death.
	--John 8:52
%
Are you greater than our father Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets. Who 
do you think you are?”
	--John 8:53
%
Jesus replied, “If I glorify myself, my glory means nothing. My Father, whom 
you claim as your God, is the one who glorifies me.
	--John 8:54
%
Though you do not know him, I know him. If I said I did not, I would be a liar 
like you, but I do know him and obey his word.
	--John 8:55
%
Your father Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing my day; he saw it and was 
glad.”
	--John 8:56
%
“You are not yet fifty years old,” they said to him, “and you have seen 
Abraham!”
	--John 8:57
%
“Very truly I tell you,” Jesus answered, “before Abraham was born, I 
am!”
	--John 8:58
%
At this, they picked up stones to stone him, but Jesus hid himself, slipping 
away from the temple grounds.
	--John 8:59
%
As he went along, he saw a man blind from birth.
	--John 9:1
%
His disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he 
was born blind?”
	--John 9:2
%
“Neither this man nor his parents sinned,” said Jesus, “but this happened 
so that the works of God might be displayed in him.
	--John 9:3
%
As long as it is day, we must do the works of him who sent me. Night is coming, 
when no one can work.
	--John 9:4
%
While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”
	--John 9:5
%
After saying this, he spit on the ground, made some mud with the saliva, and 
put it on the man’s eyes.
	--John 9:6
%
“Go,” he told him, “wash in the Pool of Siloam” (this word means 
“Sent”). So the man went and washed, and came home seeing.
	--John 9:7
%
His neighbors and those who had formerly seen him begging asked, “Isn’t 
this the same man who used to sit and beg?”
	--John 9:8
%
Some claimed that he was. Others said, “No, he only looks like him.” But he 
himself insisted, “I am the man.”
	--John 9:9
%
“How then were your eyes opened?” they asked.
	--John 9:10
%
He replied, “The man they call Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes. He 
told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and then I could see.”
	--John 9:11
%
“Where is this man?” they asked him. “I don’t know,” he said.
	--John 9:12
%
They brought to the Pharisees the man who had been blind.
	--John 9:13
%
Now the day on which Jesus had made the mud and opened the man’s eyes was a 
Sabbath.
	--John 9:14
%
Therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. “He put 
mud on my eyes,” the man replied, “and I washed, and now I see.”
	--John 9:15
%
Some of the Pharisees said, “This man is not from God, for he does not keep 
the Sabbath.” But others asked, “How can a sinner perform such signs?” So 
they were divided.
	--John 9:16
%
Then they turned again to the blind man, “What have you to say about him? It 
was your eyes he opened.” The man replied, “He is a prophet.”
	--John 9:17
%
They still did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight 
until they sent for the man’s parents.
	--John 9:18
%
“Is this your son?” they asked. “Is this the one you say was born blind? 
How is it that now he can see?”
	--John 9:19
%
“We know he is our son,” the parents answered, “and we know he was born 
blind.
	--John 9:20
%
But how he can see now, or who opened his eyes, we don’t know. Ask him. He is 
of age; he will speak for himself.”
	--John 9:21
%
His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders, who 
already had decided that anyone who acknowledged that Jesus was the Messiah 
would be put out of the synagogue.
	--John 9:22
%
That was why his parents said, “He is of age; ask him.”
	--John 9:23
%
A second time they summoned the man who had been blind. “Give glory to God by 
telling the truth,” they said. “We know this man is a sinner.”
	--John 9:24
%
He replied, “Whether he is a sinner or not, I don’t know. One thing I do 
know. I was blind but now I see!”
	--John 9:25
%
Then they asked him, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?”
	--John 9:26
%
He answered, “I have told you already and you did not listen. Why do you want 
to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples too?”
	--John 9:27
%
Then they hurled insults at him and said, “You are this fellow’s disciple! 
We are disciples of Moses!
	--John 9:28
%
We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this fellow, we don’t even know 
where he comes from.”
	--John 9:29
%
The man answered, “Now that is remarkable! You don’t know where he comes 
from, yet he opened my eyes.
	--John 9:30
%
We know that God does not listen to sinners. He listens to the godly person who 
does his will.
	--John 9:31
%
Nobody has ever heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind.
	--John 9:32
%
If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.”
	--John 9:33
%
To this they replied, “You were steeped in sin at birth; how dare you lecture 
us!” And they threw him out.
	--John 9:34
%
Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and when he found him, he said, “Do 
you believe in the Son of Man?”
	--John 9:35
%
“Who is he, sir?” the man asked. “Tell me so that I may believe in him.”
	--John 9:36
%
Jesus said, “You have now seen him; in fact, he is the one speaking with 
you.”
	--John 9:37
%
Then the man said, “Lord, I believe,” and he worshiped him.
	--John 9:38
%
Jesus said, “For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind will 
see and those who see will become blind.”
	--John 9:39
%
Some Pharisees who were with him heard him say this and asked, “What? Are we 
blind too?”
	--John 9:40
%
Jesus said, “If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin; but now that 
you claim you can see, your guilt remains.
	--John 9:41
%
“Very truly I tell you Pharisees, anyone who does not enter the sheep pen by 
the gate, but climbs in by some other way, is a thief and a robber.
	--John 10:1
%
The one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.
	--John 10:2
%
The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He 
calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.
	--John 10:3
%
When he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and his sheep 
follow him because they know his voice.
	--John 10:4
%
But they will never follow a stranger; in fact, they will run away from him 
because they do not recognize a stranger’s voice.”
	--John 10:5
%
Jesus used this figure of speech, but the Pharisees did not understand what he 
was telling them.
	--John 10:6
%
Therefore Jesus said again, “Very truly I tell you, I am the gate for the 
sheep.
	--John 10:7
%
All who have come before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep have not 
listened to them.
	--John 10:8
%
I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved. They will come in and 
go out, and find pasture.
	--John 10:9
%
The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may 
have life, and have it to the full.
	--John 10:10
%
“I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
	--John 10:11
%
The hired hand is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep. So when he sees 
the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and runs away. Then the wolf attacks the 
flock and scatters it.
	--John 10:12
%
The man runs away because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep.
	--John 10:13
%
“I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me—
	--John 10:14
%
just as the Father knows me and I know the Father—and I lay down my life for 
the sheep.
	--John 10:15
%
I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them also. They 
too will listen to my voice, and there shall be one flock and one shepherd.
	--John 10:16
%
The reason my Father loves me is that I lay down my life—only to take it up 
again.
	--John 10:17
%
No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority 
to lay it down and authority to take it up again. This command I received from 
my Father.”
	--John 10:18
%
The Jews who heard these words were again divided.
	--John 10:19
%
Many of them said, “He is demon-possessed and raving mad. Why listen to 
him?”
	--John 10:20
%
But others said, “These are not the sayings of a man possessed by a demon. 
Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?”
	--John 10:21
%
Then came the Festival of Dedication at Jerusalem. It was winter,
	--John 10:22
%
and Jesus was in the temple courts walking in Solomon’s Colonnade.
	--John 10:23
%
The Jews who were there gathered around him, saying, “How long will you keep 
us in suspense? If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly.”
	--John 10:24
%
Jesus answered, “I did tell you, but you do not believe. The works I do in my 
Father’s name testify about me,
	--John 10:25
%
but you do not believe because you are not my sheep.
	--John 10:26

My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me.
	--John 10:27
%
I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them 
out of my hand.
	--John 10:28
%
My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch 
them out of my Father’s hand.
	--John 10:29
%
I and the Father are one.”
	--John 10:30
%
Again his Jewish opponents picked up stones to stone him,
	--John 10:31
%
but Jesus said to them, “I have shown you many good works from the Father. 
For which of these do you stone me?”
	--John 10:32
%
“We are not stoning you for any good work,” they replied, “but for 
blasphemy, because you, a mere man, claim to be God.”
	--John 10:33
%
Jesus answered them, “Is it not written in your Law, ‘I have said you are 
“gods”’?
	--John 10:34
%
If he called them ‘gods,’ to whom the word of God came—and Scripture 
cannot be set aside—
	--John 10:35
%
what about the one whom the Father set apart as his very own and sent into the 
world? Why then do you accuse me of blasphemy because I said, ‘I am God’s 
Son’?
	--John 10:36
%
Do not believe me unless I do the works of my Father.
	--John 10:37
%
But if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, that 
you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.”
	--John 10:38
%
Again they tried to seize him, but he escaped their grasp.
	--John 10:39
%
Then Jesus went back across the Jordan to the place where John had been 
baptizing in the early days. There he stayed,
	--John 10:40
%
and many people came to him. They said, “Though John never performed a sign, 
all that John said about this man was true.”
	--John 10:41
%
And in that place many believed in Jesus.
	--John 10:42
%
Now a man named Lazarus was sick. He was from Bethany, the village of Mary and 
her sister Martha.
	--John 11:1
%
(This Mary, whose brother Lazarus now lay sick, was the same one who poured 
perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair.)
	--John 11:2
%
So the sisters sent word to Jesus, “Lord, the one you love is sick.”
	--John 11:3
%
When he heard this, Jesus said, “This sickness will not end in death. No, it 
is for God’s glory so that God’s Son may be glorified through it.”
	--John 11:4
%
Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.
	--John 11:5
%
So when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was two more days,
	--John 11:6
%
and then he said to his disciples, “Let us go back to Judea.”
	--John 11:7
%
“But Rabbi,” they said, “a short while ago the Jews there tried to stone 
you, and yet you are going back?”
	--John 11:8
%
Jesus answered, “Are there not twelve hours of daylight? Anyone who walks in 
the daytime will not stumble, for they see by this world’s light.
	--John 11:9
%
It is when a person walks at night that they stumble, for they have no light.”
	--John 11:10
%
After he had said this, he went on to tell them, “Our friend Lazarus has 
fallen asleep; but I am going there to wake him up.”
	--John 11:11
%
His disciples replied, “Lord, if he sleeps, he will get better.”
	--John 11:12
%
Jesus had been speaking of his death, but his disciples thought he meant 
natural sleep.
	--John 11:13
%
So then he told them plainly, “Lazarus is dead,
	--John 11:14
%
and for your sake I am glad I was not there, so that you may believe. But let 
us go to him.”
	--John 11:15
%
Then Thomas (also known as Didymus) said to the rest of the disciples, “Let 
us also go, that we may die with him.”
	--John 11:16
%
On his arrival, Jesus found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four 
days.
	--John 11:17
%
Now Bethany was less than two miles from Jerusalem,
	--John 11:18
%
and many Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them in the loss of their 
brother.
	--John 11:19
%
When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him, but Mary 
stayed at home.
	--John 11:20
%
“Lord,” Martha said to Jesus, “if you had been here, my brother would not 
have died.
	--John 11:21
%
But I know that even now God will give you whatever you ask.”
	--John 11:22
%
Jesus said to her, “Your brother will rise again.”
	--John 11:23
%
Martha answered, “I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last 
day.”
	--John 11:24
%
Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes 
in me will live, even though they die;
	--John 11:25
%
and whoever lives by believing in me will never die. Do you believe this?”
	--John 11:26
%
“Yes, Lord,” she replied, “I believe that you are the Messiah, the Son of 
God, who is to come into the world.”
	--John 11:27
%
After she had said this, she went back and called her sister Mary aside. “The 
Teacher is here,” she said, “and is asking for you.”
	--John 11:28
%
When Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to him.
	--John 11:29
%
Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still at the place where 
Martha had met him.
	--John 11:30
%
When the Jews who had been with Mary in the house, comforting her, noticed how 
quickly she got up and went out, they followed her, supposing she was going to 
the tomb to mourn there.
	--John 11:31
%
When Mary reached the place where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet 
and said, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.”
	--John 11:32
%
When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come along with her also 
weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled.
	--John 11:33
%
“Where have you laid him?” he asked. “Come and see, Lord,” they replied.
	--John 11:34
%
Jesus wept.
	--John 11:35
%
Then the Jews said, “See how he loved him!”
	--John 11:36
%
But some of them said, “Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man 
have kept this man from dying?”
	--John 11:37
%
Jesus, once more deeply moved, came to the tomb. It was a cave with a stone 
laid across the entrance.
	--John 11:38
%
“Take away the stone,” he said. “But, Lord,” said Martha, the sister of 
the dead man, “by this time there is a bad odor, for he has been there four 
days.”
	--John 11:39
%
Then Jesus said, “Did I not tell you that if you believe, you will see the 
glory of God?”
	--John 11:40
%
So they took away the stone. Then Jesus looked up and said, “Father, I thank 
you that you have heard me.
	--John 11:41
%
I knew that you always hear me, but I said this for the benefit of the people 
standing here, that they may believe that you sent me.”
	--John 11:42
%
When he had said this, Jesus called in a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out!”
	--John 11:43
%
The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen, and a 
cloth around his face. Jesus said to them, “Take off the grave clothes and 
let him go.”
	--John 11:44
%
Therefore many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary, and had seen what Jesus 
did, believed in him.
	--John 11:45
%
But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.
	--John 11:46
%
Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin. 
“What are we accomplishing?” they asked. “Here is this man performing 
many signs.
	--John 11:47
%
If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and then the 
Romans will come and take away both our temple and our nation.”
	--John 11:48
%
Then one of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, spoke up, 
“You know nothing at all!
	--John 11:49
%
You do not realize that it is better for you that one man die for the people 
than that the whole nation perish.”
	--John 11:50
%
He did not say this on his own, but as high priest that year he prophesied that 
Jesus would die for the Jewish nation,
	--John 11:51
%
and not only for that nation but also for the scattered children of God, to 
bring them together and make them one.
	--John 11:52
%
So from that day on they plotted to take his life.
	--John 11:53
%
Therefore Jesus no longer moved about publicly among the people of Judea. 
Instead he withdrew to a region near the wilderness, to a village called 
Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples.
	--John 11:54
%
When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, many went up from the country 
to Jerusalem for their ceremonial cleansing before the Passover.
	--John 11:55
%
They kept looking for Jesus, and as they stood in the temple courts they asked 
one another, “What do you think? Isn’t he coming to the festival at all?”
	--John 11:56
%
But the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that anyone who found 
out where Jesus was should report it so that they might arrest him.
	--John 11:57
%
Six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus lived, whom 
Jesus had raised from the dead.
	--John 12:1
%
Here a dinner was given in Jesus’ honor. Martha served, while Lazarus was 
among those reclining at the table with him.
	--John 12:2
%
Then Mary took about a pint of pure nard, an expensive perfume; she poured it 
on Jesus’ feet and wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled 
with the fragrance of the perfume.
	--John 12:3
%
But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was later to betray him, objected,
	--John 12:4
%
“Why wasn’t this perfume sold and the money given to the poor? It was worth 
a year’s wages.”
	--John 12:5
%
He did not say this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief; 
as keeper of the money bag, he used to help himself to what was put into it.
	--John 12:6
%
“Leave her alone,” Jesus replied. “It was intended that she should save 
this perfume for the day of my burial.
	--John 12:7
%
You will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have me.”
	--John 12:8
%
Meanwhile a large crowd of Jews found out that Jesus was there and came, not 
only because of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.
	--John 12:9
%
So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus as well,
	--John 12:10
%
for on account of him many of the Jews were going over to Jesus and believing 
in him.
	--John 12:11
%
The next day the great crowd that had come for the festival heard that Jesus 
was on his way to Jerusalem.
	--John 12:12
%
They took palm branches and went out to meet him, shouting, “Hosanna!” 
“Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!” “Blessed is the king 
of Israel!”
	--John 12:13
%
Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it, as it is written:
	--John 12:14
%
“Do not be afraid, Daughter Zion; see, your king is coming, seated on a 
donkey’s colt.”
	--John 12:15
%
At first his disciples did not understand all this. Only after Jesus was 
glorified did they realize that these things had been written about him and 
that these things had been done to him.
	--John 12:16
%
Now the crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised 
him from the dead continued to spread the word.
	--John 12:17
%
Many people, because they had heard that he had performed this sign, went out 
to meet him.
	--John 12:18
%
So the Pharisees said to one another, “See, this is getting us nowhere. Look 
how the whole world has gone after him!”
	--John 12:19
%
Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the festival.
	--John 12:20
%
They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request. 
“Sir,” they said, “we would like to see Jesus.”
	--John 12:21
%
Philip went to tell Andrew; Andrew and Philip in turn told Jesus.
	--John 12:22
%
Jesus replied, “The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.
	--John 12:23
%
Very truly I tell you, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, 
it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds.
	--John 12:24
%
Anyone who loves their life will lose it, while anyone who hates their life in 
this world will keep it for eternal life.
	--John 12:25
%
Whoever serves me must follow me; and where I am, my servant also will be. My 
Father will honor the one who serves me.
	--John 12:26
%
“Now my soul is troubled, and what shall I say? ‘Father, save me from this 
hour’? No, it was for this very reason I came to this hour.
	--John 12:27
%
Father, glorify your name!” Then a voice came from heaven, “I have 
glorified it, and will glorify it again.”
	--John 12:28
%
The crowd that was there and heard it said it had thundered; others said an 
angel had spoken to him.
	--John 12:29
%
Jesus said, “This voice was for your benefit, not mine.
	--John 12:30
%
Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this world will 
be driven out.
	--John 12:31
%
And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.”
	--John 12:32
%
He said this to show the kind of death he was going to die.
	--John 12:33
%
The crowd spoke up, “We have heard from the Law that the Messiah will remain 
forever, so how can you say, ‘The Son of Man must be lifted up’? Who is 
this ‘Son of Man’?”
	--John 12:34
%
Then Jesus told them, “You are going to have the light just a little while 
longer. Walk while you have the light, before darkness overtakes you. Whoever 
walks in the dark does not know where they are going.
	--John 12:35
%
Believe in the light while you have the light, so that you may become children 
of light.” When he had finished speaking, Jesus left and hid himself from 
them.
	--John 12:36
%
Even after Jesus had performed so many signs in their presence, they still 
would not believe in him.
	--John 12:37
%
This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet: “Lord, who has believed 
our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”
	--John 12:38
%
For this reason they could not believe, because, as Isaiah says elsewhere:
	--John 12:39
%
“He has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts, so they can neither see 
with their eyes, nor understand with their hearts, nor turn—and I would heal 
them.”
	--John 12:40
%
Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus’ glory and spoke about him.
	--John 12:41
%
Yet at the same time many even among the leaders believed in him. But because 
of the Pharisees they would not openly acknowledge their faith for fear they 
would be put out of the synagogue;
	--John 12:42
%
for they loved human praise more than praise from God.
	--John 12:43
%
Then Jesus cried out, “Whoever believes in me does not believe in me only, 
but in the one who sent me.
	--John 12:44
%
The one who looks at me is seeing the one who sent me.
	--John 12:45
%
I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in me should 
stay in darkness.
	--John 12:46
%
“If anyone hears my words but does not keep them, I do not judge that person. 
For I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world.
	--John 12:47
%
There is a judge for the one who rejects me and does not accept my words; the 
very words I have spoken will condemn them at the last day.
	--John 12:48
%
For I did not speak on my own, but the Father who sent me commanded me to say 
all that I have spoken.
	--John 12:49
%
I know that his command leads to eternal life. So whatever I say is just what 
the Father has told me to say.”
	--John 12:50
%
It was just before the Passover Festival. Jesus knew that the hour had come for 
him to leave this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in 
the world, he loved them to the end.
	--John 13:1
%
The evening meal was in progress, and the devil had already prompted Judas, the 
son of Simon Iscariot, to betray Jesus.
	--John 13:2
%
Jesus knew that the Father had put all things under his power, and that he had 
come from God and was returning to God;
	--John 13:3
%
so he got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel 
around his waist.
	--John 13:4
%
After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples’ 
feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him.
	--John 13:5
%
He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, “Lord, are you going to wash my 
feet?”
	--John 13:6
%
Jesus replied, “You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will 
understand.”
	--John 13:7
%
“No,” said Peter, “you shall never wash my feet.” Jesus answered, 
“Unless I wash you, you have no part with me.”
	--John 13:8
%
“Then, Lord,” Simon Peter replied, “not just my feet but my hands and my 
head as well!”
	--John 13:9
%
Jesus answered, “Those who have had a bath need only to wash their feet; 
their whole body is clean. And you are clean, though not every one of you.”
	--John 13:10
%
For he knew who was going to betray him, and that was why he said not every one 
was clean.
	--John 13:11
%
When he had finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and returned to 
his place. “Do you understand what I have done for you?” he asked them.
	--John 13:12
%
“You call me ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord,’ and rightly so, for that is what I 
am.
	--John 13:13
%
Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash 
one another’s feet.
	--John 13:14
%
I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you.
	--John 13:15
%
Very truly I tell you, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a 
messenger greater than the one who sent him.
	--John 13:16
%
Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.
	--John 13:17
%
“I am not referring to all of you; I know those I have chosen. But this is to 
fulfill this passage of Scripture: ‘He who shared my bread has turned against 
me.’
	--John 13:18
%
“I am telling you now before it happens, so that when it does happen you will 
believe that I am who I am.
	--John 13:19
%
Very truly I tell you, whoever accepts anyone I send accepts me; and whoever 
accepts me accepts the one who sent me.”
	--John 13:20
%
After he had said this, Jesus was troubled in spirit and testified, “Very 
truly I tell you, one of you is going to betray me.”
	--John 13:21
%
His disciples stared at one another, at a loss to know which of them he meant.
	--John 13:22
%
One of them, the disciple whom Jesus loved, was reclining next to him.
	--John 13:23
%
Simon Peter motioned to this disciple and said, “Ask him which one he 
means.”
	--John 13:24
%
Leaning back against Jesus, he asked him, “Lord, who is it?”
	--John 13:25
%
Jesus answered, “It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread when I 
have dipped it in the dish.” Then, dipping the piece of bread, he gave it to 
Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.
	--John 13:26
%
As soon as Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him. So Jesus told him, 
“What you are about to do, do quickly.”
	--John 13:27
%
But no one at the meal understood why Jesus said this to him.
	--John 13:28
%
Since Judas had charge of the money, some thought Jesus was telling him to buy 
what was needed for the festival, or to give something to the poor.
	--John 13:29
%
As soon as Judas had taken the bread, he went out. And it was night.
	--John 13:30
%
When he was gone, Jesus said, “Now the Son of Man is glorified and God is 
glorified in him.
	--John 13:31
%
If God is glorified in him, God will glorify the Son in himself, and will 
glorify him at once.
	--John 13:32
%
“My children, I will be with you only a little longer. You will look for me, 
and just as I told the Jews, so I tell you now: Where I am going, you cannot 
come.
	--John 13:33
%
“A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must 
love one another.
	--John 13:34
%
By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one 
another.”
	--John 13:35
%
Simon Peter asked him, “Lord, where are you going?” Jesus replied, “Where 
I am going, you cannot follow now, but you will follow later.”
	--John 13:36
%
Peter asked, “Lord, why can’t I follow you now? I will lay down my life for 
you.”
	--John 13:37
%
Then Jesus answered, “Will you really lay down your life for me? Very truly I 
tell you, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times!
	--John 13:38
%
“Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God; believe also in me.
	--John 14:1
%
My Father’s house has many rooms; if that were not so, would I have told you 
that I am going there to prepare a place for you?
	--John 14:2
%
And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be 
with me that you also may be where I am.
	--John 14:3
%
You know the way to the place where I am going.”
	--John 14:4
%
Thomas said to him, “Lord, we don’t know where you are going, so how can we 
know the way?”
	--John 14:5
%
Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the 
Father except through me.
	--John 14:6
%
If you really know me, you will know my Father as well. From now on, you do 
know him and have seen him.”
	--John 14:7
%
Philip said, “Lord, show us the Father and that will be enough for us.”
	--John 14:8
%
Jesus answered: “Don’t you know me, Philip, even after I have been among 
you such a long time? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you 
say, ‘Show us the Father’?
	--John 14:9
%
Don’t you believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The 
words I say to you I do not speak on my own authority. Rather, it is the 
Father, living in me, who is doing his work.
	--John 14:10
%
Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; or at 
least believe on the evidence of the works themselves.
	--John 14:11
%
Very truly I tell you, whoever believes in me will do the works I have been 
doing, and they will do even greater things than these, because I am going to 
the Father.
	--John 14:12
%
And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Father may be glorified 
in the Son.
	--John 14:13
%
You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.
	--John 14:14
%
“If you love me, keep my commands.
	--John 14:15
%
And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another advocate to help you 
and be with you forever—
	--John 14:16
%
the Spirit of truth. The world cannot accept him, because it neither sees him 
nor knows him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be in you.
	--John 14:17
%
I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you.
	--John 14:18
%
Before long, the world will not see me anymore, but you will see me. Because I 
live, you also will live.
	--John 14:19
%
On that day you will realize that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I 
am in you.
	--John 14:20
%
Whoever has my commands and keeps them is the one who loves me. The one who 
loves me will be loved by my Father, and I too will love them and show myself 
to them.”
	--John 14:21
%
Then Judas (not Judas Iscariot) said, “But, Lord, why do you intend to show 
yourself to us and not to the world?”
	--John 14:22
%
Jesus replied, “Anyone who loves me will obey my teaching. My Father will 
love them, and we will come to them and make our home with them.
	--John 14:23
%
Anyone who does not love me will not obey my teaching. These words you hear are 
not my own; they belong to the Father who sent me.

%
“All this I have spoken while still with you.
	--John 14:25
%
But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will 
teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.
	--John 14:26

Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world 
gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.

“You heard me say, ‘I am going away and I am coming back to you.’ If you 
loved me, you would be glad that I am going to the Father, for the Father is 
greater than I.
	--John 14:28
%
I have told you now before it happens, so that when it does happen you will 
believe.
	--John 14:29
%
I will not say much more to you, for the prince of this world is coming. He has 
no hold over me,
	--John 14:30
%
but he comes so that the world may learn that I love the Father and do exactly 
what my Father has commanded me. “Come now; let us leave.
	--John 14:31
%
“I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener.
	--John 15:1
%
He cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit, while every branch that 
does bear fruit he prunes so that it will be even more fruitful.
	--John 15:2
%
You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you.
	--John 15:3
%
Remain in me, as I also remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it 
must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me.
	--John 15:4
%
“I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you 
will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.
	--John 15:5
%
If you do not remain in me, you are like a branch that is thrown away and 
withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned.
	--John 15:6
%
If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it 
will be done for you.
	--John 15:7
%
This is to my Father’s glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to 
be my disciples.
	--John 15:8
%
“As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Now remain in my love.
	--John 15:9
%
If you keep my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have kept my 
Father’s commands and remain in his love.
	--John 15:10
%
I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be 
complete.
	--John 15:11
%
My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you.
	--John 15:12
%
Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.
	--John 15:13
%
You are my friends if you do what I command.
	--John 15:14
%
I no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know his master’s 
business. Instead, I have called you friends, for everything that I learned 
from my Father I have made known to you.
	--John 15:15
%
You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you so that you might go 
and bear fruit—fruit that will last—and so that whatever you ask in my name 
the Father will give you.
	--John 15:16
%
This is my command: Love each other.
	--John 15:17
%
“If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first.
	--John 15:18
%
If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do 
not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why 
the world hates you.
	--John 15:19
%
Remember what I told you: ‘A servant is not greater than his master.’ If 
they persecuted me, they will persecute you also. If they obeyed my teaching, 
they will obey yours also.
	--John 15:20
%
They will treat you this way because of my name, for they do not know the one 
who sent me.
	--John 15:21
%
If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin; but now 
they have no excuse for their sin.
	--John 15:22
%
Whoever hates me hates my Father as well.
	--John 15:23
%
If I had not done among them the works no one else did, they would not be 
guilty of sin. As it is, they have seen, and yet they have hated both me and my 
Father.
	--John 15:24
%
But this is to fulfill what is written in their Law: ‘They hated me without 
reason.’
	--John 15:25
%
“When the Advocate comes, whom I will send to you from the Father—the 
Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father—he will testify about me.
	--John 15:26
%
And you also must testify, for you have been with me from the beginning.
	--John 15:27
%
“All this I have told you so that you will not fall away.
	--John 16:1
%
They will put you out of the synagogue; in fact, the time is coming when anyone 
who kills you will think they are offering a service to God.
	--John 16:2
%
They will do such things because they have not known the Father or me.
	--John 16:3
%
I have told you this, so that when their time comes you will remember that I 
warned you about them. I did not tell you this from the beginning because I was 
with you,
	--John 16:4
%
but now I am going to him who sent me. None of you asks me, ‘Where are you 
going?’
	--John 16:5
%
Rather, you are filled with grief because I have said these things.
	--John 16:6
%
But very truly I tell you, it is for your good that I am going away. Unless I 
go away, the Advocate will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you.
	--John 16:7
%
When he comes, he will prove the world to be in the wrong about sin and 
righteousness and judgment:
	--John 16:8
%
about sin, because people do not believe in me;
	--John 16:9
%
about righteousness, because I am going to the Father, where you can see me no 
longer;
	--John 16:10
%
and about judgment, because the prince of this world now stands condemned.
	--John 16:11
%
“I have much more to say to you, more than you can now bear.
	--John 16:12
%
But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all the truth. 
He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will 
tell you what is yet to come.
	--John 16:13
%
He will glorify me because it is from me that he will receive what he will make 
known to you.
	--John 16:14
%
All that belongs to the Father is mine. That is why I said the Spirit will 
receive from me what he will make known to you.”
	--John 16:15
%
Jesus went on to say, “In a little while you will see me no more, and then 
after a little while you will see me.”
	--John 16:16
%
At this, some of his disciples said to one another, “What does he mean by 
saying, ‘In a little while you will see me no more, and then after a little 
while you will see me,’ and ‘Because I am going to the Father’?”
	--John 16:17
%
They kept asking, “What does he mean by ‘a little while’? We don’t 
understand what he is saying.”
	--John 16:18
%
Jesus saw that they wanted to ask him about this, so he said to them, “Are 
you asking one another what I meant when I said, ‘In a little while you will 
see me no more, and then after a little while you will see me’?
	--John 16:19
%
Very truly I tell you, you will weep and mourn while the world rejoices. You 
will grieve, but your grief will turn to joy.
	--John 16:20
%
A woman giving birth to a child has pain because her time has come; but when 
her baby is born she forgets the anguish because of her joy that a child is 
born into the world.
	--John 16:21
%
So with you: Now is your time of grief, but I will see you again and you will 
rejoice, and no one will take away your joy.
	--John 16:22
%
In that day you will no longer ask me anything. Very truly I tell you, my 
Father will give you whatever you ask in my name.
	--John 16:23
%
Until now you have not asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive, 
and your joy will be complete.
	--John 16:24
%
“Though I have been speaking figuratively, a time is coming when I will no 
longer use this kind of language but will tell you plainly about my Father.
	--John 16:25
%
In that day you will ask in my name. I am not saying that I will ask the Father 
on your behalf.
	--John 16:26
%
No, the Father himself loves you because you have loved me and have believed 
that I came from God.
	--John 16:27
%
I came from the Father and entered the world; now I am leaving the world and 
going back to the Father.”
	--John 16:28
%
Then Jesus’ disciples said, “Now you are speaking clearly and without 
figures of speech.
	--John 16:29
%
Now we can see that you know all things and that you do not even need to have 
anyone ask you questions. This makes us believe that you came from God.”
	--John 16:30
%
“Do you now believe?” Jesus replied.
	--John 16:31
%
“A time is coming and in fact has come when you will be scattered, each to 
your own home. You will leave me all alone. Yet I am not alone, for my Father 
is with me.
	--John 16:32
%
“I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this 
world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.”
	--John 16:33
%
After Jesus said this, he looked toward heaven and prayed: “Father, the hour 
has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son may glorify you.
	--John 17:1
%
For you granted him authority over all people that he might give eternal life 
to all those you have given him.
	--John 17:2
%
Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus 
Christ, whom you have sent.
	--John 17:3
%
I have brought you glory on earth by finishing the work you gave me to do.
	--John 17:4
%
And now, Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you 
before the world began.
	--John 17:5
%
“I have revealed you to those whom you gave me out of the world. They were 
yours; you gave them to me and they have obeyed your word.
	--John 17:6
%
Now they know that everything you have given me comes from you.
	--John 17:7
%
For I gave them the words you gave me and they accepted them. They knew with 
certainty that I came from you, and they believed that you sent me.
	--John 17:8
%
I pray for them. I am not praying for the world, but for those you have given 
me, for they are yours.
	--John 17:9
%
All I have is yours, and all you have is mine. And glory has come to me through 
them.
	--John 17:10
%
I will remain in the world no longer, but they are still in the world, and I am 
coming to you. Holy Father, protect them by the power of your name, the name 
you gave me, so that they may be one as we are one.
	--John 17:11
%
While I was with them, I protected them and kept them safe by that name you 
gave me. None has been lost except the one doomed to destruction so that 
Scripture would be fulfilled.
	--John 17:12
%
“I am coming to you now, but I say these things while I am still in the 
world, so that they may have the full measure of my joy within them.
	--John 17:13
%
I have given them your word and the world has hated them, for they are not of 
the world any more than I am of the world.
	--John 17:14
%
My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them 
from the evil one.
	--John 17:15
%
They are not of the world, even as I am not of it.
	--John 17:16
%
Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth.
	--John 17:17
%
As you sent me into the world, I have sent them into the world.
	--John 17:18
%
For them I sanctify myself, that they too may be truly sanctified.
	--John 17:19
%
“My prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in 
me through their message,
	--John 17:20
%
that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May 
they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me.
	--John 17:21
%
I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are 
one—
	--John 17:22
%
I in them and you in me—so that they may be brought to complete unity. Then 
the world will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved 
me.
	--John 17:23
%
“Father, I want those you have given me to be with me where I am, and to see 
my glory, the glory you have given me because you loved me before the creation 
of the world.
	--John 17:24
%
“Righteous Father, though the world does not know you, I know you, and they 
know that you have sent me.
	--John 17:25
%
I have made you known to them, and will continue to make you known in order 
that the love you have for me may be in them and that I myself may be in 
them.”
	--John 17:26
%
When he had finished praying, Jesus left with his disciples and crossed the 
Kidron Valley. On the other side there was a garden, and he and his disciples 
went into it.
	--John 18:1
%
Now Judas, who betrayed him, knew the place, because Jesus had often met there 
with his disciples.
	--John 18:2
%
So Judas came to the garden, guiding a detachment of soldiers and some 
officials from the chief priests and the Pharisees. They were carrying torches, 
lanterns and weapons.
	--John 18:3
%
Jesus, knowing all that was going to happen to him, went out and asked them, 
“Who is it you want?”
	--John 18:4
%
“Jesus of Nazareth,” they replied. “I am he,” Jesus said. (And Judas 
the traitor was standing there with them.)
	--John 18:5
%
When Jesus said, “I am he,” they drew back and fell to the ground.
	--John 18:6
%
Again he asked them, “Who is it you want?” “Jesus of Nazareth,” they 
said.
	--John 18:7
%
Jesus answered, “I told you that I am he. If you are looking for me, then let 
these men go.”
	--John 18:8
%
This happened so that the words he had spoken would be fulfilled: “I have not 
lost one of those you gave me.”
	--John 18:9
%
Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest’s 
servant, cutting off his right ear. (The servant’s name was Malchus.)
	--John 18:10
%
Jesus commanded Peter, “Put your sword away! Shall I not drink the cup the 
Father has given me?”
	--John 18:11
%
Then the detachment of soldiers with its commander and the Jewish officials 
arrested Jesus. They bound him
	--John 18:12
%
and brought him first to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high 
priest that year.
	--John 18:13
%
Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jewish leaders that it would be good 
if one man died for the people.
	--John 18:14
%
Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus. Because this disciple 
was known to the high priest, he went with Jesus into the high priest’s 
courtyard,
	--John 18:15
%
but Peter had to wait outside at the door. The other disciple, who was known to 
the high priest, came back, spoke to the servant girl on duty there and brought 
Peter in.
	--John 18:16
%
“You aren’t one of this man’s disciples too, are you?” she asked Peter. 
He replied, “I am not.”
	--John 18:17
%
It was cold, and the servants and officials stood around a fire they had made 
to keep warm. Peter also was standing with them, warming himself.
	--John 18:18
%
Meanwhile, the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and his 
teaching.
	--John 18:19
%
“I have spoken openly to the world,” Jesus replied. “I always taught in 
synagogues or at the temple, where all the Jews come together. I said nothing 
in secret.
	--John 18:20
%
Why question me? Ask those who heard me. Surely they know what I said.”
	--John 18:21
%
When Jesus said this, one of the officials nearby slapped him in the face. 
“Is this the way you answer the high priest?” he demanded.
	--John 18:22
%
“If I said something wrong,” Jesus replied, “testify as to what is wrong. 
But if I spoke the truth, why did you strike me?”
	--John 18:23
%
Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.
	--John 18:24
%
Meanwhile, Simon Peter was still standing there warming himself. So they asked 
him, “You aren’t one of his disciples too, are you?” He denied it, 
saying, “I am not.”
	--John 18:25
%
One of the high priest’s servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had 
cut off, challenged him, “Didn’t I see you with him in the garden?”
	--John 18:26
%
Again Peter denied it, and at that moment a rooster began to crow.
	--John 18:27
%
Then the Jewish leaders took Jesus from Caiaphas to the palace of the Roman 
governor. By now it was early morning, and to avoid ceremonial uncleanness they 
did not enter the palace, because they wanted to be able to eat the Passover.
	--John 18:28
%
So Pilate came out to them and asked, “What charges are you bringing against 
this man?”
	--John 18:29
%
“If he were not a criminal,” they replied, “we would not have handed him 
over to you.”
	--John 18:30
%
Pilate said, “Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law.” “But we 
have no right to execute anyone,” they objected.
	--John 18:31
%
This took place to fulfill what Jesus had said about the kind of death he was 
going to die.
	--John 18:32
%
Pilate then went back inside the palace, summoned Jesus and asked him, “Are 
you the king of the Jews?”
	--John 18:33
%
“Is that your own idea,” Jesus asked, “or did others talk to you about 
me?”
	--John 18:34
%
“Am I a Jew?” Pilate replied. “Your own people and chief priests handed 
you over to me. What is it you have done?”
	--John 18:35
%
Jesus said, “My kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my servants would 
fight to prevent my arrest by the Jewish leaders. But now my kingdom is from 
another place.”
	--John 18:36
%
“You are a king, then!” said Pilate. Jesus answered, “You say that I am a 
king. In fact, the reason I was born and came into the world is to testify to 
the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me.”
	--John 18:37
%
“What is truth?” retorted Pilate. With this he went out again to the Jews 
gathered there and said, “I find no basis for a charge against him.
	--John 18:38
%
But it is your custom for me to release to you one prisoner at the time of the 
Passover. Do you want me to release ‘the king of the Jews’?”
	--John 18:39
%
They shouted back, “No, not him! Give us Barabbas!” Now Barabbas had taken 
part in an uprising.
	--John 18:40
%
Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged.
	--John 19:1
%
The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They 
clothed him in a purple robe
	--John 19:2
%
and went up to him again and again, saying, “Hail, king of the Jews!” And 
they slapped him in the face.
	--John 19:3
%
Once more Pilate came out and said to the Jews gathered there, “Look, I am 
bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge 
against him.”
	--John 19:4
%
When Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate 
said to them, “Here is the man!”
	--John 19:5
%
As soon as the chief priests and their officials saw him, they shouted, 
“Crucify! Crucify!” But Pilate answered, “You take him and crucify him. 
As for me, I find no basis for a charge against him.”
	--John 19:6
%
The Jewish leaders insisted, “We have a law, and according to that law he 
must die, because he claimed to be the Son of God.”
	--John 19:7
%
When Pilate heard this, he was even more afraid,
	--John 19:8
%
and he went back inside the palace. “Where do you come from?” he asked 
Jesus, but Jesus gave him no answer.
	--John 19:9
%
“Do you refuse to speak to me?” Pilate said. “Don’t you realize I have 
power either to free you or to crucify you?”
	--John 19:10
%
Jesus answered, “You would have no power over me if it were not given to you 
from above. Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater 
sin.”
	--John 19:11
%
From then on, Pilate tried to set Jesus free, but the Jewish leaders kept 
shouting, “If you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who 
claims to be a king opposes Caesar.”
	--John 19:12
%
When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge’s seat 
at a place known as the Stone Pavement (which in Aramaic is Gabbatha).
	--John 19:13
%
It was the day of Preparation of the Passover; it was about noon. “Here is 
your king,” Pilate said to the Jews.
	--John 19:14
%
But they shouted, “Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him!” “Shall I 
crucify your king?” Pilate asked. “We have no king but Caesar,” the chief 
priests answered.
	--John 19:15
%
Finally Pilate handed him over to them to be crucified. So the soldiers took 
charge of Jesus.
	--John 19:16
%
Carrying his own cross, he went out to the place of the Skull (which in Aramaic 
is called Golgotha).
	--John 19:17
%
There they crucified him, and with him two others—one on each side and Jesus 
in the middle.
	--John 19:18
%
Pilate had a notice prepared and fastened to the cross. It read: jesus of 
nazareth, the king of the jews.
	--John 19:19
%
Many of the Jews read this sign, for the place where Jesus was crucified was 
near the city, and the sign was written in Aramaic, Latin and Greek.
	--John 19:20
%
The chief priests of the Jews protested to Pilate, “Do not write ‘The King 
of the Jews,’ but that this man claimed to be king of the Jews.”
	--John 19:21
%
Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.”
	--John 19:22
%
When the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothes, dividing them into 
four shares, one for each of them, with the undergarment remaining. This 
garment was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom.
	--John 19:23
%
“Let’s not tear it,” they said to one another. “Let’s decide by lot 
who will get it.” This happened that the scripture might be fulfilled that 
said, “They divided my clothes among them and cast lots for my garment.” So 
this is what the soldiers did.
	--John 19:24
%
Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mother’s sister, Mary the wife 
of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.
	--John 19:25
%
When Jesus saw his mother there, and the disciple whom he loved standing 
nearby, he said to her, “Woman, here is your son,”
	--John 19:26
%
and to the disciple, “Here is your mother.” From that time on, this 
disciple took her into his home.
	--John 19:27
%
Later, knowing that everything had now been finished, and so that Scripture 
would be fulfilled, Jesus said, “I am thirsty.”
	--John 19:28
%
A jar of wine vinegar was there, so they soaked a sponge in it, put the sponge 
on a stalk of the hyssop plant, and lifted it to Jesus’ lips.
	--John 19:29
%
When he had received the drink, Jesus said, “It is finished.” With that, he 
bowed his head and gave up his spirit.
	--John 19:30
%
Now it was the day of Preparation, and the next day was to be a special 
Sabbath. Because the Jewish leaders did not want the bodies left on the crosses 
during the Sabbath, they asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies 
taken down.
	--John 19:31
%
The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first man who had been 
crucified with Jesus, and then those of the other.
	--John 19:32
%
But when they came to Jesus and found that he was already dead, they did not 
break his legs.
	--John 19:33
%
Instead, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus’ side with a spear, bringing a 
sudden flow of blood and water.
	--John 19:34
%
The man who saw it has given testimony, and his testimony is true. He knows 
that he tells the truth, and he testifies so that you also may believe.
	--John 19:35
%
These things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled: “Not one of 
his bones will be broken,”
	--John 19:36
%
and, as another scripture says, “They will look on the one they have 
pierced.”
	--John 19:37
%
Later, Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate for the body of Jesus. Now Joseph was a 
disciple of Jesus, but secretly because he feared the Jewish leaders. With 
Pilate’s permission, he came and took the body away.
	--John 19:38
%
He was accompanied by Nicodemus, the man who earlier had visited Jesus at 
night. Nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five 
pounds.
	--John 19:39
%
Taking Jesus’ body, the two of them wrapped it, with the spices, in strips of 
linen. This was in accordance with Jewish burial customs.
	--John 19:40
%
At the place where Jesus was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a 
new tomb, in which no one had ever been laid.
	--John 19:41
%
Because it was the Jewish day of Preparation and since the tomb was nearby, 
they laid Jesus there.
	--John 19:42
%
Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene 
went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance.
	--John 20:1
%
So she came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved, 
and said, “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don’t know 
where they have put him!”
	--John 20:2
%
So Peter and the other disciple started for the tomb.
	--John 20:3
%
Both were running, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb 
first.
	--John 20:4
%
He bent over and looked in at the strips of linen lying there but did not go in.
	--John 20:5
%
Then Simon Peter came along behind him and went straight into the tomb. He saw 
the strips of linen lying there,
	--John 20:6
%
as well as the cloth that had been wrapped around Jesus’ head. The cloth was 
still lying in its place, separate from the linen.
	--John 20:7
%
Finally the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went inside. 
He saw and believed.
	--John 20:8
%
(They still did not understand from Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the 
dead.)
	--John 20:9
%
Then the disciples went back to where they were staying.
	--John 20:10
%
Now Mary stood outside the tomb crying. As she wept, she bent over to look into 
the tomb
	--John 20:11
%
and saw two angels in white, seated where Jesus’ body had been, one at the 
head and the other at the foot.
	--John 20:12
%
They asked her, “Woman, why are you crying?” “They have taken my Lord 
away,” she said, “and I don’t know where they have put him.”
	--John 20:13
%
At this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not 
realize that it was Jesus.
	--John 20:14
%
He asked her, “Woman, why are you crying? Who is it you are looking for?” 
Thinking he was the gardener, she said, “Sir, if you have carried him away, 
tell me where you have put him, and I will get him.”
	--John 20:15
%
Jesus said to her, “Mary.” She turned toward him and cried out in Aramaic, 
“Rabboni!” (which means “Teacher”).
	--John 20:16
%
Jesus said, “Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. 
Go instead to my brothers and tell them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and 
your Father, to my God and your God.’”
	--John 20:17
%
Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news: “I have seen the Lord!” 
And she told them that he had said these things to her.
	--John 20:18
%
On the evening of that first day of the week, when the disciples were together, 
with the doors locked for fear of the Jewish leaders, Jesus came and stood 
among them and said, “Peace be with you!”
	--John 20:19
%
After he said this, he showed them his hands and side. The disciples were 
overjoyed when they saw the Lord.
	--John 20:20
%
Again Jesus said, “Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I am sending 
you.”
	--John 20:21
%
And with that he breathed on them and said, “Receive the Holy Spirit.
	--John 20:22
%
If you forgive anyone’s sins, their sins are forgiven; if you do not forgive 
them, they are not forgiven.”
	--John 20:23
%
Now Thomas (also known as Didymus), one of the Twelve, was not with the 
disciples when Jesus came.
	--John 20:24
%
So the other disciples told him, “We have seen the Lord!” But he said to 
them, “Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the 
nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.”
	--John 20:25
%
A week later his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. 
Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, 
“Peace be with you!”
	--John 20:26
%
Then he said to Thomas, “Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your 
hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.”
	--John 20:27
%
Thomas said to him, “My Lord and my God!”
	--John 20:28
%
Then Jesus told him, “Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed 
are those who have not seen and yet have believed.”
	--John 20:29
%
Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are 
not recorded in this book.
	--John 20:30
%
But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son 
of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.
	--John 20:31
%
Afterward Jesus appeared again to his disciples, by the Sea of Galilee. It 
happened this way:
	--John 21:1
%
Simon Peter, Thomas (also known as Didymus), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, 
the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples were together.
	--John 21:2
%
“I’m going out to fish,” Simon Peter told them, and they said, “We’ll 
go with you.” So they went out and got into the boat, but that night they 
caught nothing.
	--John 21:3
%
Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not 
realize that it was Jesus.
	--John 21:4
%
He called out to them, “Friends, haven’t you any fish?” “No,” they 
answered.
	--John 21:5
%
He said, “Throw your net on the right side of the boat and you will find 
some.” When they did, they were unable to haul the net in because of the 
large number of fish.
	--John 21:6
%
Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” As soon 
as Simon Peter heard him say, “It is the Lord,” he wrapped his outer 
garment around him (for he had taken it off) and jumped into the water.
	--John 21:7
%
The other disciples followed in the boat, towing the net full of fish, for they 
were not far from shore, about a hundred yards.
	--John 21:8
%
When they landed, they saw a fire of burning coals there with fish on it, and 
some bread.
	--John 21:9
%
Jesus said to them, “Bring some of the fish you have just caught.”
	--John 21:10
%
So Simon Peter climbed back into the boat and dragged the net ashore. It was 
full of large fish, 153, but even with so many the net was not torn.
	--John 21:11
%
Jesus said to them, “Come and have breakfast.” None of the disciples dared 
ask him, “Who are you?” They knew it was the Lord.
	--John 21:12
%
Jesus came, took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish.
	--John 21:13
%
This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised 
from the dead.
	--John 21:14
%
When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon son of John, 
do you love me more than these?” “Yes, Lord,” he said, “you know that I 
love you.” Jesus said, “Feed my lambs.”
	--John 21:15
%
Again Jesus said, “Simon son of John, do you love me?” He answered, “Yes, 
Lord, you know that I love you.” Jesus said, “Take care of my sheep.”
	--John 21:16
%
The third time he said to him, “Simon son of John, do you love me?” Peter 
was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, “Do you love me?” He said, 
“Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you.” Jesus said, “Feed 
my sheep.
	--John 21:17
%
Very truly I tell you, when you were younger you dressed yourself and went 
where you wanted; but when you are old you will stretch out your hands, and 
someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go.”
	--John 21:18
%
Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God. 
Then he said to him, “Follow me!”
	--John 21:19
%
Peter turned and saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved was following them. 
(This was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper and had said, 
“Lord, who is going to betray you?”)
	--John 21:20
%
When Peter saw him, he asked, “Lord, what about him?”
	--John 21:21
%
Jesus answered, “If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that 
to you? You must follow me.”
	--John 21:22
%
Because of this, the rumor spread among the believers that this disciple would 
not die. But Jesus did not say that he would not die; he only said, “If I 
want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you?”
	--John 21:23
%
This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down. We 
know that his testimony is true.
	--John 21:24
%
Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I 
suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would 
be written.
	--John 21:25

Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James, To those who have been

Dear friends, although I was very eager to write to you about the salvation we 
share, I felt compelled to write and urge you to contend for the faith that was 
once for all entrusted to God’s holy people.
	 --Jude 1:3
%
For certain individuals whose condemnation was written about long ago have 
secretly slipped in among you. They are ungodly people, who pervert the grace 
of our God into a license for immorality and deny Jesus Christ our only 
Sovereign and Lord.
	 --Jude 1:4
%
Though you already know all this, I want to remind you that the Lord at one 
time delivered his people out of Egypt, but later destroyed those who did not 
believe.
	 --Jude 1:5
%
And the angels who did not keep their positions of authority but abandoned 
their proper dwelling—these he has kept in darkness, bound with everlasting 
chains for judgment on the great Day.
	 --Jude 1:6
%
In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves 
up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who 
suffer the punishment of eternal fire.
	 --Jude 1:7
%
In the very same way, on the strength of their dreams these ungodly people 
pollute their own bodies, reject authority and heap abuse on celestial beings.
	 --Jude 1:8
%
But even the archangel Michael, when he was disputing with the devil about the 
body of Moses, did not himself dare to condemn him for slander but said, “The 
Lord rebuke you!”
	 --Jude 1:9
%
Yet these people slander whatever they do not understand, and the very things 
they do understand by instinct—as irrational animals do—will destroy them.
	 --Jude 1:10
%
Woe to them! They have taken the way of Cain; they have rushed for profit into 
Balaam’s error; they have been destroyed in Korah’s rebellion.
	 --Jude 1:11
%
These people are blemishes at your love feasts, eating with you without the 
slightest qualm—shepherds who feed only themselves. They are clouds without 
rain, blown along by the wind; autumn trees, without fruit and uprooted—twice 
dead.
	 --Jude 1:12
%
They are wild waves of the sea, foaming up their shame; wandering stars, for 
whom blackest darkness has been reserved forever.

Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about them: “See, the Lord is coming 
with thousands upon thousands of his holy ones

to judge everyone, and to convict all of them of all the ungodly acts they have 
committed in their ungodliness, and of all the defiant words ungodly sinners 
have spoken against him.”
	 --Jude 1:15

These people are grumblers and faultfinders; they follow their own evil 
desires; they boast about themselves and flatter others for their own advantage.

But, dear friends, remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ foretold.
	 --Jude 1:17
%
They said to you, “In the last times there will be scoffers who will follow 
their own ungodly desires.”
	 --Jude 1:18

These are the people who divide you, who follow mere natural instincts and do 
not have the Spirit.
	 --Jude 1:19

praying in the Holy Spirit,
	 --Jude 1:20

keep yourselves in God’s love as you wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus 
Christ to bring you to eternal life.

Be merciful to those who doubt;

save others by snatching them from the fire; to others show mercy, mixed with 
fear—hating even the clothing stained by corrupted flesh.

To him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you before his 
glorious presence without fault and with great joy—

%Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been 
fulfilled among us,
	--Luke 1:1
%
just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were 
eyewitnesses and servants of the word.
	--Luke 1:2
%
With this in mind, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from 
the beginning, I too decided to write an orderly account for you, most 
excellent Theophilus,
	--Luke 1:3
%
so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.
	--Luke 1:4
%
In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah, who 
belonged to the priestly division of Abijah; his wife Elizabeth was also a 
descendant of Aaron.
	--Luke 1:5
%
Both of them were righteous in the sight of God, observing all the Lord’s 
commands and decrees blamelessly.
	--Luke 1:6
%
But they were childless because Elizabeth was not able to conceive, and they 
were both very old.
	--Luke 1:7
%
Once when Zechariah’s division was on duty and he was serving as priest 
before God,
	--Luke 1:8
%
he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to go into the 
temple of the Lord and burn incense.
	--Luke 1:9
%
And when the time for the burning of incense came, all the assembled worshipers 
were praying outside.
	--Luke 1:10
%
Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the 
altar of incense.
	--Luke 1:11
%
When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and was gripped with fear.
	--Luke 1:12
%
But the angel said to him: “Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been 
heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to call him John.
	--Luke 1:13
%
He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice because of his birth,
	--Luke 1:14
%
for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He is never to take wine or 
other fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even before 
he is born.
	--Luke 1:15
%
He will bring back many of the people of Israel to the Lord their God.
	--Luke 1:16
%
And he will go on before the Lord, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn 
the hearts of the parents to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom 
of the righteous—to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.”
	--Luke 1:17
%
Zechariah asked the angel, “How can I be sure of this? I am an old man and my 
wife is well along in years.”
	--Luke 1:18
%
The angel said to him, “I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I 
have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news.
	--Luke 1:19
%
And now you will be silent and not able to speak until the day this happens, 
because you did not believe my words, which will come true at their appointed 
time.”
	--Luke 1:20
%
Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so 
long in the temple.
	--Luke 1:21
%
When he came out, he could not speak to them. They realized he had seen a 
vision in the temple, for he kept making signs to them but remained unable to 
speak.
	--Luke 1:22
%
When his time of service was completed, he returned home.
	--Luke 1:23
%
After this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in 
seclusion.
	--Luke 1:24
%
“The Lord has done this for me,” she said. “In these days he has shown 
his favor and taken away my disgrace among the people.”
	--Luke 1:25
%
In the sixth month of Elizabeth’s pregnancy, God sent the angel Gabriel to 
Nazareth, a town in Galilee,
	--Luke 1:26
%
to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. 
The virgin’s name was Mary.
	--Luke 1:27
%
The angel went to her and said, “Greetings, you who are highly favored! The 
Lord is with you.”
	--Luke 1:28
%
Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this 
might be.
	--Luke 1:29
%
But the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary; you have found favor with 
God.
	--Luke 1:30
%
You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to call him Jesus.
	--Luke 1:31
%
He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will 
give him the throne of his father David,
	--Luke 1:32
%
and he will reign over Jacob’s descendants forever; his kingdom will never 
end.”
	--Luke 1:33
%
“How will this be,” Mary asked the angel, “since I am a virgin?”
	--Luke 1:34
%
The angel answered, “The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the 
Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called the 
Son of God.
	--Luke 1:35
%
Even Elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old age, and she 
who was said to be unable to conceive is in her sixth month.
	--Luke 1:36
%
For no word from God will ever fail.”
	--Luke 1:37
%
“I am the Lord’s servant,” Mary answered. “May your word to me be 
fulfilled.” Then the angel left her.
	--Luke 1:38
%
At that time Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judea,
	--Luke 1:39
%
where she entered Zechariah’s home and greeted Elizabeth.
	--Luke 1:40
%
When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and 
Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.
	--Luke 1:41
%
In a loud voice she exclaimed: “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is 
the child you will bear!
	--Luke 1:42
%
But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
	--Luke 1:43
%
As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb 
leaped for joy.
	--Luke 1:44
%
Blessed is she who has believed that the Lord would fulfill his promises to 
her!”
	--Luke 1:45
%
And Mary said: “My soul glorifies the Lord
	--Luke 1:46
%
    and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,
	--Luke 1:47
%
for he has been mindful of the humble state of his servant. From now on all 
generations will call me blessed,
	--Luke 1:48
%
    for the Mighty One has done great things for me— holy is his name.
	--Luke 1:49
%
His mercy extends to those who fear him, from generation to generation.
	--Luke 1:50
%
He has performed mighty deeds with his arm; he has scattered those who are 
proud in their inmost thoughts.
	--Luke 1:51
%
He has brought down rulers from their thrones but has lifted up the humble.
	--Luke 1:52
%
He has filled the hungry with good things but has sent the rich away empty.
	--Luke 1:53
%
He has helped his servant Israel, remembering to be merciful
	--Luke 1:54
%
to Abraham and his descendants forever, just as he promised our ancestors.”
	--Luke 1:55
%
Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months and then returned home.
	--Luke 1:56
%
When it was time for Elizabeth to have her baby, she gave birth to a son.
	--Luke 1:57
%
Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown her great mercy, and 
they shared her joy.
	--Luke 1:58
%
On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to 
name him after his father Zechariah,
	--Luke 1:59
%
but his mother spoke up and said, “No! He is to be called John.”
	--Luke 1:60
%
They said to her, “There is no one among your relatives who has that name.”
	--Luke 1:61
%
Then they made signs to his father, to find out what he would like to name the 
child.
	--Luke 1:62
%
He asked for a writing tablet, and to everyone’s astonishment he wrote, 
“His name is John.”
	--Luke 1:63
%
Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue set free, and he began to 
speak, praising God.
	--Luke 1:64
%
All the neighbors were filled with awe, and throughout the hill country of 
Judea people were talking about all these things.
	--Luke 1:65
%
Everyone who heard this wondered about it, asking, “What then is this child 
going to be?” For the Lord’s hand was with him.
	--Luke 1:66
%
His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied:
	--Luke 1:67
%
“Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, because he has come to his people 
and redeemed them.
	--Luke 1:68
%
He has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David
	--Luke 1:69
%
(as he said through his holy prophets of long ago),
	--Luke 1:70
%
salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us—
	--Luke 1:71
%
to show mercy to our ancestors and to remember his holy covenant,
	--Luke 1:72
%
    the oath he swore to our father Abraham:
	--Luke 1:73
%
to rescue us from the hand of our enemies, and to enable us to serve him 
without fear
	--Luke 1:74
%
    in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.
	--Luke 1:75
%
And you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most High; for you will go 
on before the Lord to prepare the way for him,
	--Luke 1:76
%
to give his people the knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their 
sins,
	--Luke 1:77
%
because of the tender mercy of our God, by which the rising sun will come to us 
from heaven
	--Luke 1:78
%
to shine on those living in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our 
feet into the path of peace.”
	--Luke 1:79
%
And the child grew and became strong in spirit; and he lived in the wilderness 
until he appeared publicly to Israel.
	--Luke 1:80
%
In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of 
the entire Roman world.
	--Luke 2:1
%
(This was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor of 
Syria.)
	--Luke 2:2
%
And everyone went to their own town to register.
	--Luke 2:3
%
So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to 
Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David.
	--Luke 2:4
%
He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and 
was expecting a child.
	--Luke 2:5
%
While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born,
	--Luke 2:6
%
and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in cloths and 
placed him in a manger, because there was no guest room available for them.
	--Luke 2:7
%
And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over 
their flocks at night.
	--Luke 2:8
%
An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around 
them, and they were terrified.
	--Luke 2:9
%
But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid. I bring you good news that 
will cause great joy for all the people.
	--Luke 2:10
%
Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, 
the Lord.
	--Luke 2:11
%
This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in 
a manger.”
	--Luke 2:12
%
Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising 
God and saying,
	--Luke 2:13
%
“Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace to those on whom his 
favor rests.”
	--Luke 2:14
%
When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one 
another, “Let’s go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which 
the Lord has told us about.”
	--Luke 2:15
%
So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in 
the manger.
	--Luke 2:16
%
When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them 
about this child,
	--Luke 2:17
%
and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them.
	--Luke 2:18
%
But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart.
	--Luke 2:19

The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had 
heard and seen, which were just as they had been told.

On the eighth day, when it was time to circumcise the child, he was named 
Jesus, the name the angel had given him before he was conceived.
	--Luke 2:21
%
When the time came for the purification rites required by the Law of Moses, 
Joseph and Mary took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord
	--Luke 2:22
%
(as it is written in the Law of the Lord, “Every firstborn male is to be 
consecrated to the Lord”),
	--Luke 2:23
%
and to offer a sacrifice in keeping with what is said in the Law of the Lord: 
“a pair of doves or two young pigeons.”

Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon, who was righteous and devout. 
He was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was on him.
	--Luke 2:25
%
It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he 
had seen the Lord’s Messiah.
	--Luke 2:26
%
Moved by the Spirit, he went into the temple courts. When the parents brought 
in the child Jesus to do for him what the custom of the Law required,
	--Luke 2:27
%
Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying:
	--Luke 2:28
%
“Sovereign Lord, as you have promised, you may now dismiss your servant in 
peace.
	--Luke 2:29
%
For my eyes have seen your salvation,
	--Luke 2:30
%
    which you have prepared in the sight of all nations:
	--Luke 2:31
%
a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and the glory of your people Israel.”
	--Luke 2:32
%
The child’s father and mother marveled at what was said about him.
	--Luke 2:33
%
Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother: “This child is 
destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign 
that will be spoken against,
	--Luke 2:34
%
so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. And a sword will pierce 
your own soul too.”
	--Luke 2:35

There was also a prophet, Anna, the daughter of Penuel, of the tribe of Asher. 
She was very old; she had lived with her husband seven years after her marriage,
	--Luke 2:36
%
and then was a widow until she was eighty-four. She never left the temple but 
worshiped night and day, fasting and praying.
	--Luke 2:37
%
Coming up to them at that very moment, she gave thanks to God and spoke about 
the child to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem.
	--Luke 2:38
%
When Joseph and Mary had done everything required by the Law of the Lord, they 
returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth.

And the child grew and became strong; he was filled with wisdom, and the grace

Every year Jesus’ parents went to Jerusalem for the Festival of the Passover.
	--Luke 2:41
%
When he was twelve years old, they went up to the festival, according to the 
custom.
	--Luke 2:42
%
After the festival was over, while his parents were returning home, the boy 
Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but they were unaware of it.
	--Luke 2:43
%
Thinking he was in their company, they traveled on for a day. Then they began 
looking for him among their relatives and friends.
	--Luke 2:44
%
When they did not find him, they went back to Jerusalem to look for him.
	--Luke 2:45
%
After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the 
teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.
	--Luke 2:46
%
Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers.
	--Luke 2:47
%
When his parents saw him, they were astonished. His mother said to him, “Son, 
why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously 
searching for you.”
	--Luke 2:48
%
“Why were you searching for me?” he asked. “Didn’t you know I had to be 
in my Father’s house?”
	--Luke 2:49
%
But they did not understand what he was saying to them.
	--Luke 2:50
%
Then he went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. But his 
mother treasured all these things in her heart.
	--Luke 2:51
%
And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.

In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar—when Pontius Pilate was 
governor of Judea, Herod tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of 
Iturea and Traconitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene—
	--Luke 3:1
%
during the high-priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John 
son of Zechariah in the wilderness.
	--Luke 3:2
%
He went into all the country around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of 
repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
	--Luke 3:3
%
As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet: “A voice of 
one calling in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight 
paths for him.
	--Luke 3:4
%
Every valley shall be filled in, every mountain and hill made low. The crooked 
roads shall become straight, the rough ways smooth.
	--Luke 3:5
%
And all people will see God’s salvation.’”
	--Luke 3:6
%
John said to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him, “You brood of 
vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?
	--Luke 3:7
%
Produce fruit in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to 
yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you that out of 
these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.
	--Luke 3:8
%
The ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not 
produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.”
	--Luke 3:9
%
“What should we do then?” the crowd asked.
	--Luke 3:10
%
John answered, “Anyone who has two shirts should share with the one who has 
none, and anyone who has food should do the same.”
	--Luke 3:11
%
Even tax collectors came to be baptized. “Teacher,” they asked, “what 
should we do?”
	--Luke 3:12
%
“Don’t collect any more than you are required to,” he told them.
	--Luke 3:13
%
Then some soldiers asked him, “And what should we do?” He replied, 
“Don’t extort money and don’t accuse people falsely—be content with 
your pay.”
	--Luke 3:14
%
The people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts if 
John might possibly be the Messiah.
	--Luke 3:15
%
John answered them all, “I baptize you with water. But one who is more 
powerful than I will come, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to 
untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
	--Luke 3:16
%
His winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing floor and to gather 
the wheat into his barn, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable 
fire.”
	--Luke 3:17
%
And with many other words John exhorted the people and proclaimed the good news 
to them.
	--Luke 3:18
%
But when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of his marriage to Herodias, 
his brother’s wife, and all the other evil things he had done,
	--Luke 3:19
%
Herod added this to them all: He locked John up in prison.
	--Luke 3:20
%
When all the people were being baptized, Jesus was baptized too. And as he was 
praying, heaven was opened
	--Luke 3:21
%
and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice 
came from heaven: “You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.”

Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, left the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into 
the wilderness,
	--Luke 4:1
%
where for forty days he was tempted by the devil. He ate nothing during those 
days, and at the end of them he was hungry.
	--Luke 4:2
%
The devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become 
bread.”
	--Luke 4:3
%
Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone.’”
	--Luke 4:4
%
The devil led him up to a high place and showed him in an instant all the 
kingdoms of the world.
	--Luke 4:5
%
And he said to him, “I will give you all their authority and splendor; it has 
been given to me, and I can give it to anyone I want to.
	--Luke 4:6
%
If you worship me, it will all be yours.”
	--Luke 4:7
%
Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Worship the Lord your God and serve him 
only.’”
	--Luke 4:8
%
The devil led him to Jerusalem and had him stand on the highest point of the 
temple. “If you are the Son of God,” he said, “throw yourself down from 
here.
	--Luke 4:9
%
For it is written: “‘He will command his angels concerning you to guard you 
carefully;
	--Luke 4:10
%
they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot 
against a stone.’”
	--Luke 4:11
%
Jesus answered, “It is said: ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the 
test.’”
	--Luke 4:12
%
When the devil had finished all this tempting, he left him until an opportune 
time.
	--Luke 4:13
%
Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about him spread 
through the whole countryside.
	--Luke 4:14
%
He was teaching in their synagogues, and everyone praised him.
	--Luke 4:15
%
He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he 
went into the synagogue, as was his custom. He stood up to read,
	--Luke 4:16
%
and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. Unrolling it, he found 
the place where it is written:
	--Luke 4:17
%
“The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good 
news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and 
recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free,
	--Luke 4:18
%
    to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor.”
	--Luke 4:19
%
Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant and sat down. The 
eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him.
	--Luke 4:20
%
He began by saying to them, “Today this scripture is fulfilled in your 
hearing.”
	--Luke 4:21
%
All spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his 
lips. “Isn’t this Joseph’s son?” they asked.
	--Luke 4:22
%
Jesus said to them, “Surely you will quote this proverb to me: ‘Physician, 
heal yourself!’ And you will tell me, ‘Do here in your hometown what we 
have heard that you did in Capernaum.’”
	--Luke 4:23
%
“Truly I tell you,” he continued, “no prophet is accepted in his hometown.
	--Luke 4:24
%
I assure you that there were many widows in Israel in Elijah’s time, when the 
sky was shut for three and a half years and there was a severe famine 
throughout the land.
	--Luke 4:25
%
Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them, but to a widow in Zarephath in the 
region of Sidon.
	--Luke 4:26
%
And there were many in Israel with leprosy in the time of Elisha the prophet, 
yet not one of them was cleansed—only Naaman the Syrian.”
	--Luke 4:27
%
All the people in the synagogue were furious when they heard this.
	--Luke 4:28
%
They got up, drove him out of the town, and took him to the brow of the hill on 
which the town was built, in order to throw him off the cliff.
	--Luke 4:29
%
But he walked right through the crowd and went on his way.
	--Luke 4:30
%
Then he went down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and on the Sabbath he taught 
the people.
	--Luke 4:31
%
They were amazed at his teaching, because his words had authority.
	--Luke 4:32
%
In the synagogue there was a man possessed by a demon, an impure spirit. He 
cried out at the top of his voice,
	--Luke 4:33
%
“Go away! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to 
destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!”
	--Luke 4:34
%
“Be quiet!” Jesus said sternly. “Come out of him!” Then the demon threw 
the man down before them all and came out without injuring him.
	--Luke 4:35
%
All the people were amazed and said to each other, “What words these are! 
With authority and power he gives orders to impure spirits and they come out!”
	--Luke 4:36
%
And the news about him spread throughout the surrounding area.
	--Luke 4:37
%
Jesus left the synagogue and went to the home of Simon. Now Simon’s 
mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they asked Jesus to help her.
	--Luke 4:38
%
So he bent over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. She got up at once 
and began to wait on them.
	--Luke 4:39
%
At sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who had various kinds of sickness, 
and laying his hands on each one, he healed them.
	--Luke 4:40
%
Moreover, demons came out of many people, shouting, “You are the Son of 
God!” But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak, because they 
knew he was the Messiah.
	--Luke 4:41
%
At daybreak, Jesus went out to a solitary place. The people were looking for 
him and when they came to where he was, they tried to keep him from leaving 
them.
	--Luke 4:42
%
But he said, “I must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God to the 
other towns also, because that is why I was sent.”
	--Luke 4:43
%
And he kept on preaching in the synagogues of Judea.
	--Luke 4:44
%
One day as Jesus was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret, the people were 
crowding around him and listening to the word of God.
	--Luke 5:1
%
He saw at the water’s edge two boats, left there by the fishermen, who were 
washing their nets.
	--Luke 5:2
%
He got into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon, and asked him to put 
out a little from shore. Then he sat down and taught the people from the boat.
	--Luke 5:3
%
When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, “Put out into deep water, 
and let down the nets for a catch.”
	--Luke 5:4
%
Simon answered, “Master, we’ve worked hard all night and haven’t caught 
anything. But because you say so, I will let down the nets.”
	--Luke 5:5
%
When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets 
began to break.
	--Luke 5:6
%
So they signaled their partners in the other boat to come and help them, and 
they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink.
	--Luke 5:7
%
When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus’ knees and said, “Go away from 
me, Lord; I am a sinful man!”
	--Luke 5:8
%
For he and all his companions were astonished at the catch of fish they had 
taken,
	--Luke 5:9
%
and so were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, Simon’s partners. Then Jesus 
said to Simon, “Don’t be afraid; from now on you will fish for people.”
	--Luke 5:10
%
So they pulled their boats up on shore, left everything and followed him.
	--Luke 5:11
%
While Jesus was in one of the towns, a man came along who was covered with 
leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he fell with his face to the ground and begged him, 
“Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.”
	--Luke 5:12
%
Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. “I am willing,” he said. 
“Be clean!” And immediately the leprosy left him.
	--Luke 5:13
%
Then Jesus ordered him, “Don’t tell anyone, but go, show yourself to the 
priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a 
testimony to them.”
	--Luke 5:14
%
Yet the news about him spread all the more, so that crowds of people came to 
hear him and to be healed of their sicknesses.
	--Luke 5:15
%
But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed.
	--Luke 5:16
%
One day Jesus was teaching, and Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting 
there. They had come from every village of Galilee and from Judea and 
Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was with Jesus to heal the sick.
	--Luke 5:17
%
Some men came carrying a paralyzed man on a mat and tried to take him into the 
house to lay him before Jesus.
	--Luke 5:18
%
When they could not find a way to do this because of the crowd, they went up on 
the roof and lowered him on his mat through the tiles into the middle of the 
crowd, right in front of Jesus.
	--Luke 5:19
%
When Jesus saw their faith, he said, “Friend, your sins are forgiven.”
	--Luke 5:20
%
The Pharisees and the teachers of the law began thinking to themselves, “Who 
is this fellow who speaks blasphemy? Who can forgive sins but God alone?”
	--Luke 5:21
%
Jesus knew what they were thinking and asked, “Why are you thinking these 
things in your hearts?
	--Luke 5:22
%
Which is easier: to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and 
walk’?
	--Luke 5:23
%
But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive 
sins.” So he said to the paralyzed man, “I tell you, get up, take your mat 
and go home.”
	--Luke 5:24
%
Immediately he stood up in front of them, took what he had been lying on and 
went home praising God.
	--Luke 5:25
%
Everyone was amazed and gave praise to God. They were filled with awe and said, 
“We have seen remarkable things today.”
	--Luke 5:26
%
After this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector by the name of Levi sitting 
at his tax booth. “Follow me,” Jesus said to him,
	--Luke 5:27
%
and Levi got up, left everything and followed him.
	--Luke 5:28
%
Then Levi held a great banquet for Jesus at his house, and a large crowd of tax 
collectors and others were eating with them.
	--Luke 5:29
%
But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their sect 
complained to his disciples, “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors 
and sinners?”
	--Luke 5:30
%
Jesus answered them, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.
	--Luke 5:31
%
I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”
	--Luke 5:32
%
They said to him, “John’s disciples often fast and pray, and so do the 
disciples of the Pharisees, but yours go on eating and drinking.”
	--Luke 5:33
%
Jesus answered, “Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast while he is 
with them?
	--Luke 5:34
%
But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; in those 
days they will fast.”
	--Luke 5:35
%
He told them this parable: “No one tears a piece out of a new garment to 
patch an old one. Otherwise, they will have torn the new garment, and the patch 
from the new will not match the old.
	--Luke 5:36
%
And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the new wine will 
burst the skins; the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined.
	--Luke 5:37
%
No, new wine must be poured into new wineskins.
	--Luke 5:38
%
And no one after drinking old wine wants the new, for they say, ‘The old is 
better.’”
	--Luke 5:39
%
One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and his disciples began to 
pick some heads of grain, rub them in their hands and eat the kernels.
	--Luke 6:1
%
Some of the Pharisees asked, “Why are you doing what is unlawful on the 
Sabbath?”
	--Luke 6:2
%
Jesus answered them, “Have you never read what David did when he and his 
companions were hungry?
	--Luke 6:3
%
He entered the house of God, and taking the consecrated bread, he ate what is 
lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions.”
	--Luke 6:4
%
Then Jesus said to them, “The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”
	--Luke 6:5
%
On another Sabbath he went into the synagogue and was teaching, and a man was 
there whose right hand was shriveled.
	--Luke 6:6
%
The Pharisees and the teachers of the law were looking for a reason to accuse 
Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath.
	--Luke 6:7
%
But Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to the man with the shriveled 
hand, “Get up and stand in front of everyone.” So he got up and stood there.
	--Luke 6:8
%
Then Jesus said to them, “I ask you, which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do 
good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?”
	--Luke 6:9
%
He looked around at them all, and then said to the man, “Stretch out your 
hand.” He did so, and his hand was completely restored.
	--Luke 6:10
%
But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law were furious and began to discuss 
with one another what they might do to Jesus.
	--Luke 6:11
%
One of those days Jesus went out to a mountainside to pray, and spent the night 
praying to God.
	--Luke 6:12
%
When morning came, he called his disciples to him and chose twelve of them, 
whom he also designated apostles:
	--Luke 6:13
%
Simon (whom he named Peter), his brother Andrew, James, John, Philip, 
Bartholomew,
	--Luke 6:14
%
Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon who was called the Zealot,
	--Luke 6:15
%
Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.
	--Luke 6:16
%
He went down with them and stood on a level place. A large crowd of his 
disciples was there and a great number of people from all over Judea, from 
Jerusalem, and from the coastal region around Tyre and Sidon,
	--Luke 6:17
%
who had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases. Those troubled by 
impure spirits were cured,
	--Luke 6:18
%
and the people all tried to touch him, because power was coming from him and 
healing them all.
	--Luke 6:19
%
Looking at his disciples, he said: “Blessed are you who are poor, for yours 
is the kingdom of God.
	--Luke 6:20
%
Blessed are you who hunger now, for you will be satisfied. Blessed are you who 
weep now, for you will laugh.
	--Luke 6:21
%
Blessed are you when people hate you, when they exclude you and insult you and 
reject your name as evil, because of the Son of Man.
	--Luke 6:22
%
“Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, because great is your reward in 
heaven. For that is how their ancestors treated the prophets.
	--Luke 6:23
%
“But woe to you who are rich, for you have already received your comfort.
	--Luke 6:24
%
Woe to you who are well fed now, for you will go hungry. Woe to you who laugh 
now, for you will mourn and weep.
	--Luke 6:25
%
Woe to you when everyone speaks well of you, for that is how their ancestors 
treated the false prophets.
	--Luke 6:26
%
“But to you who are listening I say: Love your enemies, do good to those who 
hate you,
	--Luke 6:27
%
bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.
	--Luke 6:28
%
If someone slaps you on one cheek, turn to them the other also. If someone 
takes your coat, do not withhold your shirt from them.

But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to

How can you say to your brother, ‘Brother, let me take the speck out of your

first take the plank out of your eye, and then you will see clearly to remove 
the speck from your brother’s eye.

“Why do you call me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say?

They are like a man building a house, who dug down deep and laid the foundation 
on rock. When a flood came, the torrent struck that house but could not shake 
it, because it was well built.
	--Luke 6:48
%
But the one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a 
man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. The moment the 
torrent struck that house, it collapsed and its destruction was complete.”
	--Luke 6:49
%
When Jesus had finished saying all this to the people who were listening, he 
entered Capernaum.
	--Luke 7:1
%
There a centurion’s servant, whom his master valued highly, was sick and 
about to die.
	--Luke 7:2
%
The centurion heard of Jesus and sent some elders of the Jews to him, asking 
him to come and heal his servant.
	--Luke 7:3
%
When they came to Jesus, they pleaded earnestly with him, “This man deserves 
to have you do this,
	--Luke 7:4
%
because he loves our nation and has built our synagogue.”
	--Luke 7:5
%
So Jesus went with them. He was not far from the house when the centurion sent 
friends to say to him: “Lord, don’t trouble yourself, for I do not deserve 
to have you come under my roof.
	--Luke 7:6
%
That is why I did not even consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the 
word, and my servant will be healed.
	--Luke 7:7
%
For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, 
‘Go,’ and he goes; and that one, ‘Come,’ and he comes. I say to my 
servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”
	--Luke 7:8
%
When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him, and turning to the crowd following 
him, he said, “I tell you, I have not found such great faith even in 
Israel.”
	--Luke 7:9
%
Then the men who had been sent returned to the house and found the servant well.
	--Luke 7:10
%
Soon afterward, Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large 
crowd went along with him.
	--Luke 7:11
%
As he approached the town gate, a dead person was being carried out—the only 
son of his mother, and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the town was 
with her.
	--Luke 7:12
%
When the Lord saw her, his heart went out to her and he said, “Don’t cry.”
	--Luke 7:13
%
Then he went up and touched the bier they were carrying him on, and the bearers 
stood still. He said, “Young man, I say to you, get up!”
	--Luke 7:14
%
The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his mother.
	--Luke 7:15
%
They were all filled with awe and praised God. “A great prophet has appeared 
among us,” they said. “God has come to help his people.”
	--Luke 7:16
%
This news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and the surrounding country.
	--Luke 7:17
%
John’s disciples told him about all these things. Calling two of them,
	--Luke 7:18
%
he sent them to the Lord to ask, “Are you the one who is to come, or should 
we expect someone else?”
	--Luke 7:19
%
When the men came to Jesus, they said, “John the Baptist sent us to you to 
ask, ‘Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?’”
	--Luke 7:20
%
At that very time Jesus cured many who had diseases, sicknesses and evil 
spirits, and gave sight to many who were blind.
	--Luke 7:21
%
So he replied to the messengers, “Go back and report to John what you have 
seen and heard: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy 
are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is 
proclaimed to the poor.
	--Luke 7:22
%
Blessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of me.”
	--Luke 7:23
%
After John’s messengers left, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: 
“What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?
	--Luke 7:24
%
If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those 
who wear expensive clothes and indulge in luxury are in palaces.
	--Luke 7:25
%
But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a 
prophet.
	--Luke 7:26
%
This is the one about whom it is written: “‘I will send my messenger ahead 
of you, who will prepare your way before you.’
	--Luke 7:27
%
I tell you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John; yet 
the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.”
	--Luke 7:28
%
(All the people, even the tax collectors, when they heard Jesus’ words, 
acknowledged that God’s way was right, because they had been baptized by John.
	--Luke 7:29
%
But the Pharisees and the experts in the law rejected God’s purpose for 
themselves, because they had not been baptized by John.)
	--Luke 7:30
%
Jesus went on to say, “To what, then, can I compare the people of this 
generation? What are they like?
	--Luke 7:31
%
They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to each 
other: “‘We played the pipe for you, and you did not dance; we sang a 
dirge, and you did not cry.’
	--Luke 7:32
%
For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, 
‘He has a demon.’
	--Luke 7:33
%
The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Here is a glutton and 
a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.’
	--Luke 7:34
%
But wisdom is proved right by all her children.”
	--Luke 7:35
%
When one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him, he went to the 
Pharisee’s house and reclined at the table.
	--Luke 7:36
%
A woman in that town who lived a sinful life learned that Jesus was eating at 
the Pharisee’s house, so she came there with an alabaster jar of perfume.
	--Luke 7:37
%
As she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her 
tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them and poured perfume on 
them.
	--Luke 7:38
%
When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, “If this 
man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman 
she is—that she is a sinner.”
	--Luke 7:39
%
Jesus answered him, “Simon, I have something to tell you.” “Tell me, 
teacher,” he said.
	--Luke 7:40
%
“Two people owed money to a certain moneylender. One owed him five hundred 
denarii, and the other fifty.
	--Luke 7:41
%
Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he forgave the debts of both. 
Now which of them will love him more?”
	--Luke 7:42
%
Simon replied, “I suppose the one who had the bigger debt forgiven.” “You 
have judged correctly,” Jesus said.
	--Luke 7:43
%
Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? I 
came into your house. You did not give me any water for my feet, but she wet my 
feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.
	--Luke 7:44
%
You did not give me a kiss, but this woman, from the time I entered, has not 
stopped kissing my feet.
	--Luke 7:45
%
You did not put oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet.
	--Luke 7:46
%
Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven—as her great love has 
shown. But whoever has been forgiven little loves little.”
	--Luke 7:47
%
Then Jesus said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.”
	--Luke 7:48
%
The other guests began to say among themselves, “Who is this who even 
forgives sins?”
	--Luke 7:49
%
Jesus said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you; go in peace.”
	--Luke 7:50
%
After this, Jesus traveled about from one town and village to another, 
proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve were with him,
	--Luke 8:1
%
and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases: Mary 
(called Magdalene) from whom seven demons had come out;
	--Luke 8:2
%
Joanna the wife of Chuza, the manager of Herod’s household; Susanna; and many 
others. These women were helping to support them out of their own means.
	--Luke 8:3
%
While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town 
after town, he told this parable:
	--Luke 8:4
%
“A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell 
along the path; it was trampled on, and the birds ate it up.
	--Luke 8:5
%
Some fell on rocky ground, and when it came up, the plants withered because 
they had no moisture.
	--Luke 8:6
%
Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the plants.
	--Luke 8:7
%
Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up and yielded a crop, a hundred 
times more than was sown.” When he said this, he called out, “Whoever has 
ears to hear, let them hear.”
	--Luke 8:8
%
His disciples asked him what this parable meant.
	--Luke 8:9
%
He said, “The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given 
to you, but to others I speak in parables, so that, “‘though seeing, they 
may not see; though hearing, they may not understand.’
	--Luke 8:10
%
“This is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God.
	--Luke 8:11
%
Those along the path are the ones who hear, and then the devil comes and takes 
away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved.
	--Luke 8:12
%
Those on the rocky ground are the ones who receive the word with joy when they 
hear it, but they have no root. They believe for a while, but in the time of 
testing they fall away.
	--Luke 8:13
%
The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear, but as they go on 
their way they are choked by life’s worries, riches and pleasures, and they 
do not mature.
	--Luke 8:14
%
But the seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart, who 
hear the word, retain it, and by persevering produce a crop.
	--Luke 8:15
%
“No one lights a lamp and hides it in a clay jar or puts it under a bed. 
Instead, they put it on a stand, so that those who come in can see the light.
	--Luke 8:16
%
For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed 
that will not be known or brought out into the open.
	--Luke 8:17
%
Therefore consider carefully how you listen. Whoever has will be given more; 
whoever does not have, even what they think they have will be taken from 
them.”
	--Luke 8:18
%
Now Jesus’ mother and brothers came to see him, but they were not able to get 
near him because of the crowd.
	--Luke 8:19
%
Someone told him, “Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to 
see you.”
	--Luke 8:20
%
He replied, “My mother and brothers are those who hear God’s word and put 
it into practice.”
	--Luke 8:21
%
One day Jesus said to his disciples, “Let us go over to the other side of the 
lake.” So they got into a boat and set out.
	--Luke 8:22
%
As they sailed, he fell asleep. A squall came down on the lake, so that the 
boat was being swamped, and they were in great danger.
	--Luke 8:23
%
The disciples went and woke him, saying, “Master, Master, we’re going to 
drown!” He got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waters; the storm 
subsided, and all was calm.
	--Luke 8:24
%
“Where is your faith?” he asked his disciples. In fear and amazement they 
asked one another, “Who is this? He commands even the winds and the water, 
and they obey him.”
	--Luke 8:25
%
They sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, which is across the lake from 
Galilee.
	--Luke 8:26
%
When Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a demon-possessed man from the town. 
For a long time this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house, but had 
lived in the tombs.
	--Luke 8:27
%
When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting at the top of 
his voice, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg 
you, don’t torture me!”
	--Luke 8:28
%
For Jesus had commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man. Many times it 
had seized him, and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard, 
he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places.
	--Luke 8:29
%
Jesus asked him, “What is your name?” “Legion,” he replied, because 
many demons had gone into him.
	--Luke 8:30
%
And they begged Jesus repeatedly not to order them to go into the Abyss.
	--Luke 8:31
%
A large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside. The demons begged Jesus 
to let them go into the pigs, and he gave them permission.
	--Luke 8:32
%
When the demons came out of the man, they went into the pigs, and the herd 
rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.
	--Luke 8:33
%
When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and reported 
this in the town and countryside,
	--Luke 8:34
%
and the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they 
found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus’ feet, 
dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.
	--Luke 8:35
%
Those who had seen it told the people how the demon-possessed man had been 
cured.
	--Luke 8:36
%
Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them, 
because they were overcome with fear. So he got into the boat and left.
	--Luke 8:37
%
The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him, but Jesus sent 
him away, saying,
	--Luke 8:38
%
“Return home and tell how much God has done for you.” So the man went away 
and told all over town how much Jesus had done for him.
	--Luke 8:39
%
Now when Jesus returned, a crowd welcomed him, for they were all expecting him.
	--Luke 8:40
%
Then a man named Jairus, a synagogue leader, came and fell at Jesus’ feet, 
pleading with him to come to his house
	--Luke 8:41
%
because his only daughter, a girl of about twelve, was dying. As Jesus was on 
his way, the crowds almost crushed him.
	--Luke 8:42
%
And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years, but no 
one could heal her.
	--Luke 8:43
%
She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately her 
bleeding stopped.
	--Luke 8:44
%
“Who touched me?” Jesus asked. When they all denied it, Peter said, 
“Master, the people are crowding and pressing against you.”
	--Luke 8:45
%
But Jesus said, “Someone touched me; I know that power has gone out from 
me.”
	--Luke 8:46
%
Then the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed, came trembling and fell 
at his feet. In the presence of all the people, she told why she had touched 
him and how she had been instantly healed.
	--Luke 8:47
%
Then he said to her, “Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace.”
	--Luke 8:48
%
While Jesus was still speaking, someone came from the house of Jairus, the 
synagogue leader. “Your daughter is dead,” he said. “Don’t bother the 
teacher anymore.”
	--Luke 8:49
%
Hearing this, Jesus said to Jairus, “Don’t be afraid; just believe, and she 
will be healed.”
	--Luke 8:50
%
When he arrived at the house of Jairus, he did not let anyone go in with him 
except Peter, John and James, and the child’s father and mother.
	--Luke 8:51
%
Meanwhile, all the people were wailing and mourning for her. “Stop 
wailing,” Jesus said. “She is not dead but asleep.”
	--Luke 8:52
%
They laughed at him, knowing that she was dead.
	--Luke 8:53
%
But he took her by the hand and said, “My child, get up!”
	--Luke 8:54
%
Her spirit returned, and at once she stood up. Then Jesus told them to give her 
something to eat.
	--Luke 8:55
%
Her parents were astonished, but he ordered them not to tell anyone what had 
happened.
	--Luke 8:56
%
When Jesus had called the Twelve together, he gave them power and authority to 
drive out all demons and to cure diseases,
	--Luke 9:1
%
and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.
	--Luke 9:2
%
He told them: “Take nothing for the journey—no staff, no bag, no bread, no 
money, no extra shirt.
	--Luke 9:3
%
Whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave that town.
	--Luke 9:4
%
If people do not welcome you, leave their town and shake the dust off your feet 
as a testimony against them.”
	--Luke 9:5
%
So they set out and went from village to village, proclaiming the good news and 
healing people everywhere.
	--Luke 9:6
%
Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was going on. And he was perplexed 
because some were saying that John had been raised from the dead,
	--Luke 9:7
%
others that Elijah had appeared, and still others that one of the prophets of 
long ago had come back to life.
	--Luke 9:8
%
But Herod said, “I beheaded John. Who, then, is this I hear such things 
about?” And he tried to see him.
	--Luke 9:9
%
When the apostles returned, they reported to Jesus what they had done. Then he 
took them with him and they withdrew by themselves to a town called Bethsaida,
	--Luke 9:10
%
but the crowds learned about it and followed him. He welcomed them and spoke to 
them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who needed healing.
	--Luke 9:11
%
Late in the afternoon the Twelve came to him and said, “Send the crowd away 
so they can go to the surrounding villages and countryside and find food and 
lodging, because we are in a remote place here.”
	--Luke 9:12
%
He replied, “You give them something to eat.” They answered, “We have 
only five loaves of bread and two fish—unless we go and buy food for all this 
crowd.”
	--Luke 9:13
%
(About five thousand men were there.) But he said to his disciples, “Have 
them sit down in groups of about fifty each.”
	--Luke 9:14
%
The disciples did so, and everyone sat down.
	--Luke 9:15
%
Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave 
thanks and broke them. Then he gave them to the disciples to distribute to the 
people.
	--Luke 9:16
%
They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls 
of broken pieces that were left over.
	--Luke 9:17
%
Once when Jesus was praying in private and his disciples were with him, he 
asked them, “Who do the crowds say I am?”
	--Luke 9:18
%
They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still 
others, that one of the prophets of long ago has come back to life.”
	--Luke 9:19
%
“But what about you?” he asked. “Who do you say I am?” Peter answered, 
“God’s Messiah.”
	--Luke 9:20
%
Jesus strictly warned them not to tell this to anyone.
	--Luke 9:21
%
And he said, “The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the 
elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and he must be killed 
and on the third day be raised to life.”
	--Luke 9:22
%
Then he said to them all: “Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny 
themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me.
	--Luke 9:23
%
For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life 
for me will save it.
	--Luke 9:24
%
What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, and yet lose or forfeit 
their very self?
	--Luke 9:25
%
Whoever is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of them 
when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy 
angels.
	--Luke 9:26
%
“Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death before 
they see the kingdom of God.”
	--Luke 9:27
%
About eight days after Jesus said this, he took Peter, John and James with him 
and went up onto a mountain to pray.
	--Luke 9:28
%
As he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became 
as bright as a flash of lightning.
	--Luke 9:29
%
Two men, Moses and Elijah, appeared in glorious splendor, talking with Jesus.
	--Luke 9:30
%
They spoke about his departure, which he was about to bring to fulfillment at 
Jerusalem.
	--Luke 9:31
%
Peter and his companions were very sleepy, but when they became fully awake, 
they saw his glory and the two men standing with him.
	--Luke 9:32
%
As the men were leaving Jesus, Peter said to him, “Master, it is good for us 
to be here. Let us put up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses and one 
for Elijah.” (He did not know what he was saying.)
	--Luke 9:33
%
While he was speaking, a cloud appeared and covered them, and they were afraid 
as they entered the cloud.
	--Luke 9:34
%
A voice came from the cloud, saying, “This is my Son, whom I have chosen; 
listen to him.”
	--Luke 9:35
%
When the voice had spoken, they found that Jesus was alone. The disciples kept 
this to themselves and did not tell anyone at that time what they had seen.
	--Luke 9:36
%
The next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met him.
	--Luke 9:37
%
A man in the crowd called out, “Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he 
is my only child.
	--Luke 9:38
%
A spirit seizes him and he suddenly screams; it throws him into convulsions so 
that he foams at the mouth. It scarcely ever leaves him and is destroying him.
	--Luke 9:39
%
I begged your disciples to drive it out, but they could not.”
	--Luke 9:40
%
“You unbelieving and perverse generation,” Jesus replied, “how long shall 
I stay with you and put up with you? Bring your son here.”
	--Luke 9:41
%
Even while the boy was coming, the demon threw him to the ground in a 
convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the impure spirit, healed the boy and gave him 
back to his father.
	--Luke 9:42
%
And they were all amazed at the greatness of God. While everyone was marveling 
at all that Jesus did, he said to his disciples,
	--Luke 9:43
%
“Listen carefully to what I am about to tell you: The Son of Man is going to 
be delivered into the hands of men.”
	--Luke 9:44
%
But they did not understand what this meant. It was hidden from them, so that 
they did not grasp it, and they were afraid to ask him about it.
	--Luke 9:45
%
An argument started among the disciples as to which of them would be the 
greatest.
	--Luke 9:46
%
Jesus, knowing their thoughts, took a little child and had him stand beside him.
	--Luke 9:47
%
Then he said to them, “Whoever welcomes this little child in my name welcomes 
me; and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. For it is the one who 
is least among you all who is the greatest.”
	--Luke 9:48
%
“Master,” said John, “we saw someone driving out demons in your name and 
we tried to stop him, because he is not one of us.”
	--Luke 9:49
%
“Do not stop him,” Jesus said, “for whoever is not against you is for 
you.”
	--Luke 9:50
%
As the time approached for him to be taken up to heaven, Jesus resolutely set 
out for Jerusalem.
	--Luke 9:51
%
And he sent messengers on ahead, who went into a Samaritan village to get 
things ready for him;
	--Luke 9:52
%
but the people there did not welcome him, because he was heading for Jerusalem.
	--Luke 9:53
%
When the disciples James and John saw this, they asked, “Lord, do you want us 
to call fire down from heaven to destroy them?”
	--Luke 9:54
%
But Jesus turned and rebuked them.
	--Luke 9:55
%
Then he and his disciples went to another village.
	--Luke 9:56
%
As they were walking along the road, a man said to him, “I will follow you 
wherever you go.”
	--Luke 9:57
%
Jesus replied, “Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has 
no place to lay his head.”
	--Luke 9:58
%
He said to another man, “Follow me.” But he replied, “Lord, first let me 
go and bury my father.”
	--Luke 9:59
%
Jesus said to him, “Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim 
the kingdom of God.”
	--Luke 9:60
%
Still another said, “I will follow you, Lord; but first let me go back and 
say goodbye to my family.”
	--Luke 9:61
%
Jesus replied, “No one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for 
service in the kingdom of God.”
	--Luke 9:62
%
After this the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them two by two ahead 
of him to every town and place where he was about to go.
	--Luke 10:1
%
He told them, “The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the 
Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field.
	--Luke 10:2
%
Go! I am sending you out like lambs among wolves.
	--Luke 10:3
%
Do not take a purse or bag or sandals; and do not greet anyone on the road.
	--Luke 10:4
%
“When you enter a house, first say, ‘Peace to this house.’
	--Luke 10:5
%
If someone who promotes peace is there, your peace will rest on them; if not, 
it will return to you.
	--Luke 10:6
%
Stay there, eating and drinking whatever they give you, for the worker deserves 
his wages. Do not move around from house to house.
	--Luke 10:7
%
“When you enter a town and are welcomed, eat what is offered to you.
	--Luke 10:8
%
Heal the sick who are there and tell them, ‘The kingdom of God has come near 
to you.’
	--Luke 10:9
%
But when you enter a town and are not welcomed, go into its streets and say,
	--Luke 10:10
%
‘Even the dust of your town we wipe from our feet as a warning to you. Yet be 
sure of this: The kingdom of God has come near.’
	--Luke 10:11
%
I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town.
	--Luke 10:12
%
“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were 
performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented 
long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
	--Luke 10:13
%
But it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you.
	--Luke 10:14
%
And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted to the heavens? No, you will go down to 
Hades.
	--Luke 10:15
%
“Whoever listens to you listens to me; whoever rejects you rejects me; but 
whoever rejects me rejects him who sent me.”
	--Luke 10:16
%
The seventy-two returned with joy and said, “Lord, even the demons submit to 
us in your name.”
	--Luke 10:17
%
He replied, “I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.
	--Luke 10:18
%
I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome 
all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you.
	--Luke 10:19
%
However, do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your 
names are written in heaven.”
	--Luke 10:20
%
At that time Jesus, full of joy through the Holy Spirit, said, “I praise you, 
Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the 
wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this 
is what you were pleased to do.
	--Luke 10:21
%
“All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son 
is except the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and 
those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.”
	--Luke 10:22
%
Then he turned to his disciples and said privately, “Blessed are the eyes 
that see what you see.
	--Luke 10:23
%
For I tell you that many prophets and kings wanted to see what you see but did 
not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.”
	--Luke 10:24
%
On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. “Teacher,” he 
asked, “what must I do to inherit eternal life?”
	--Luke 10:25
%
“What is written in the Law?” he replied. “How do you read it?”
	--Luke 10:26
%
He answered, “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your 
soul and with all your strength and with all your mind’; and, ‘Love your 
neighbor as yourself.’”
	--Luke 10:27
%
“You have answered correctly,” Jesus replied. “Do this and you will 
live.”
	--Luke 10:28
%
But he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, “And who is my 
neighbor?”
	--Luke 10:29
%
In reply Jesus said: “A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he 
was attacked by robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went 
away, leaving him half dead.
	--Luke 10:30
%
A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he 
passed by on the other side.
	--Luke 10:31
%
So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other 
side.
	--Luke 10:32
%
But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, 
he took pity on him.
	--Luke 10:33
%
He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put 
the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him.
	--Luke 10:34
%
The next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper. ‘Look 
after him,’ he said, ‘and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra 
expense you may have.’
	--Luke 10:35
%
“Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into 
the hands of robbers?”
	--Luke 10:36
%
The expert in the law replied, “The one who had mercy on him.” Jesus told 
him, “Go and do likewise.”
	--Luke 10:37
%
As Jesus and his disciples were on their way, he came to a village where a 
woman named Martha opened her home to him.
	--Luke 10:38
%
She had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord’s feet listening to what he 
said.
	--Luke 10:39
%
But Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made. She came 
to him and asked, “Lord, don’t you care that my sister has left me to do 
the work by myself? Tell her to help me!”
	--Luke 10:40
%
“Martha, Martha,” the Lord answered, “you are worried and upset about 
many things,
	--Luke 10:41
%
but few things are needed—or indeed only one. Mary has chosen what is better, 
and it will not be taken away from her.”
	--Luke 10:42
%
One day Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he finished, one of his 
disciples said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his 
disciples.”
	--Luke 11:1
%
He said to them, “When you pray, say: “‘Father, hallowed be your name, 
your kingdom come.
	--Luke 11:2
%
Give us each day our daily bread.
	--Luke 11:3
%
Forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone who sins against us. And lead 
us not into temptation.’”
	--Luke 11:4
%
Then Jesus said to them, “Suppose you have a friend, and you go to him at 
midnight and say, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves of bread;
	--Luke 11:5
%
a friend of mine on a journey has come to me, and I have no food to offer 
him.’
	--Luke 11:6
%
And suppose the one inside answers, ‘Don’t bother me. The door is already 
locked, and my children and I are in bed. I can’t get up and give you 
anything.’
	--Luke 11:7
%
I tell you, even though he will not get up and give you the bread because of 
friendship, yet because of your shameless audacity he will surely get up and 
give you as much as you need.
	--Luke 11:8
%
“So I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; 
knock and the door will be opened to you.
	--Luke 11:9
%
For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who 
knocks, the door will be opened.
	--Luke 11:10
%
“Which of you fathers, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a snake 
instead?
	--Luke 11:11
%
Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?
	--Luke 11:12
%
If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, 
how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask 
him!”
	--Luke 11:13
%
Jesus was driving out a demon that was mute. When the demon left, the man who 
had been mute spoke, and the crowd was amazed.
	--Luke 11:14
%
But some of them said, “By Beelzebul, the prince of demons, he is driving out 
demons.”
	--Luke 11:15
%
Others tested him by asking for a sign from heaven.
	--Luke 11:16
%
Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them: “Any kingdom divided against 
itself will be ruined, and a house divided against itself will fall.
	--Luke 11:17
%
If Satan is divided against himself, how can his kingdom stand? I say this 
because you claim that I drive out demons by Beelzebul.
	--Luke 11:18
%
Now if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your followers drive them 
out? So then, they will be your judges.
	--Luke 11:19
%
But if I drive out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has 
come upon you.
	--Luke 11:20
%
“When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own house, his possessions are 
safe.
	--Luke 11:21
%
But when someone stronger attacks and overpowers him, he takes away the armor 
in which the man trusted and divides up his plunder.
	--Luke 11:22
%
“Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me 
scatters.
	--Luke 11:23
%
“When an impure spirit comes out of a person, it goes through arid places 
seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says, ‘I will return to the house 
I left.’
	--Luke 11:24
%
When it arrives, it finds the house swept clean and put in order.
	--Luke 11:25
%
Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go 
in and live there. And the final condition of that person is worse than the 
first.”
	--Luke 11:26
%
As Jesus was saying these things, a woman in the crowd called out, “Blessed 
is the mother who gave you birth and nursed you.”
	--Luke 11:27
%
He replied, “Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it.”
	--Luke 11:28
%
As the crowds increased, Jesus said, “This is a wicked generation. It asks 
for a sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah.
	--Luke 11:29
%
For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so also will the Son of Man be to 
this generation.
	--Luke 11:30
%
The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with the people of this 
generation and condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to listen 
to Solomon’s wisdom; and now something greater than Solomon is here.
	--Luke 11:31
%
The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and 
condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and now something 
greater than Jonah is here.
	--Luke 11:32
%
“No one lights a lamp and puts it in a place where it will be hidden, or 
under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, so that those who come in may 
see the light.
	--Luke 11:33
%
Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eyes are healthy, your whole body 
also is full of light. But when they are unhealthy, your body also is full of 
darkness.
	--Luke 11:34
%
See to it, then, that the light within you is not darkness.
	--Luke 11:35
%
Therefore, if your whole body is full of light, and no part of it dark, it will 
be just as full of light as when a lamp shines its light on you.”
	--Luke 11:36
%
When Jesus had finished speaking, a Pharisee invited him to eat with him; so he 
went in and reclined at the table.
	--Luke 11:37
%
But the Pharisee was surprised when he noticed that Jesus did not first wash 
before the meal.
	--Luke 11:38
%
Then the Lord said to him, “Now then, you Pharisees clean the outside of the 
cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness.
	--Luke 11:39
%
You foolish people! Did not the one who made the outside make the inside also?
	--Luke 11:40
%
But now as for what is inside you—be generous to the poor, and everything 
will be clean for you.
	--Luke 11:41
%
“Woe to you Pharisees, because you give God a tenth of your mint, rue and all 
other kinds of garden herbs, but you neglect justice and the love of God. You 
should have practiced the latter without leaving the former undone.
	--Luke 11:42
%
“Woe to you Pharisees, because you love the most important seats in the 
synagogues and respectful greetings in the marketplaces.
	--Luke 11:43
%
“Woe to you, because you are like unmarked graves, which people walk over 
without knowing it.”
	--Luke 11:44
%
One of the experts in the law answered him, “Teacher, when you say these 
things, you insult us also.”
	--Luke 11:45
%
Jesus replied, “And you experts in the law, woe to you, because you load 
people down with burdens they can hardly carry, and you yourselves will not 
lift one finger to help them.
	--Luke 11:46
%
“Woe to you, because you build tombs for the prophets, and it was your 
ancestors who killed them.
	--Luke 11:47
%
So you testify that you approve of what your ancestors did; they killed the 
prophets, and you build their tombs.
	--Luke 11:48
%
Because of this, God in his wisdom said, ‘I will send them prophets and 
apostles, some of whom they will kill and others they will persecute.’
	--Luke 11:49
%
Therefore this generation will be held responsible for the blood of all the 
prophets that has been shed since the beginning of the world,
	--Luke 11:50
%
from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was killed between the 
altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, this generation will be held 
responsible for it all.
	--Luke 11:51
%
“Woe to you experts in the law, because you have taken away the key to 
knowledge. You yourselves have not entered, and you have hindered those who 
were entering.”
	--Luke 11:52
%
When Jesus went outside, the Pharisees and the teachers of the law began to 
oppose him fiercely and to besiege him with questions,
	--Luke 11:53
%
waiting to catch him in something he might say.
	--Luke 11:54
%
Meanwhile, when a crowd of many thousands had gathered, so that they were 
trampling on one another, Jesus began to speak first to his disciples, saying: 
“Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
	--Luke 12:1
%
There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not 
be made known.
	--Luke 12:2
%
What you have said in the dark will be heard in the daylight, and what you have 
whispered in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed from the roofs.
	--Luke 12:3
%
“I tell you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body and 
after that can do no more.
	--Luke 12:4
%
But I will show you whom you should fear: Fear him who, after your body has 
been killed, has authority to throw you into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him.
	--Luke 12:5
%
Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? Yet not one of them is forgotten by 
God.
	--Luke 12:6
%
Indeed, the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Don’t be afraid; you 
are worth more than many sparrows.
	--Luke 12:7
%
“I tell you, whoever publicly acknowledges me before others, the Son of Man 
will also acknowledge before the angels of God.
	--Luke 12:8
%
But whoever disowns me before others will be disowned before the angels of God.
	--Luke 12:9
%
And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but 
anyone who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
	--Luke 12:10
%
“When you are brought before synagogues, rulers and authorities, do not worry 
about how you will defend yourselves or what you will say,
	--Luke 12:11
%
for the Holy Spirit will teach you at that time what you should say.”
	--Luke 12:12
%
Someone in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the 
inheritance with me.”
	--Luke 12:13
%
Jesus replied, “Man, who appointed me a judge or an arbiter between you?”
	--Luke 12:14
%
Then he said to them, “Watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of 
greed; life does not consist in an abundance of possessions.”
	--Luke 12:15
%
And he told them this parable: “The ground of a certain rich man yielded an 
abundant harvest.
	--Luke 12:16
%
He thought to himself, ‘What shall I do? I have no place to store my crops.’
	--Luke 12:17
%
“Then he said, ‘This is what I’ll do. I will tear down my barns and build 
bigger ones, and there I will store my surplus grain.
	--Luke 12:18
%
And I’ll say to myself, “You have plenty of grain laid up for many years. 
Take life easy; eat, drink and be merry.”’
	--Luke 12:19
%
“But God said to him, ‘You fool! This very night your life will be demanded 
from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?’
	--Luke 12:20
%
“This is how it will be with whoever stores up things for themselves but is 
not rich toward God.”
	--Luke 12:21
%
Then Jesus said to his disciples: “Therefore I tell you, do not worry about 
your life, what you will eat; or about your body, what you will wear.
	--Luke 12:22
%
For life is more than food, and the body more than clothes.
	--Luke 12:23
%
Consider the ravens: They do not sow or reap, they have no storeroom or barn; 
yet God feeds them. And how much more valuable you are than birds!
	--Luke 12:24
%
Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to your life?
	--Luke 12:25
%
Since you cannot do this very little thing, why do you worry about the rest?
	--Luke 12:26
%
“Consider how the wild flowers grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell 
you, not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these.
	--Luke 12:27
%
If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today, and 
tomorrow is thrown into the fire, how much more will he clothe you—you of 
little faith!
	--Luke 12:28
%
And do not set your heart on what you will eat or drink; do not worry about it.
	--Luke 12:29
%
For the pagan world runs after all such things, and your Father knows that you 
need them.
	--Luke 12:30
%
But seek his kingdom, and these things will be given to you as well.
	--Luke 12:31
%
“Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has been pleased to give you 
the kingdom.
	--Luke 12:32
%
Sell your possessions and give to the poor. Provide purses for yourselves that 
will not wear out, a treasure in heaven that will never fail, where no thief 
comes near and no moth destroys.
	--Luke 12:33
%
For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
	--Luke 12:34
%
“Be dressed ready for service and keep your lamps burning,
	--Luke 12:35
%
like servants waiting for their master to return from a wedding banquet, so 
that when he comes and knocks they can immediately open the door for him.
	--Luke 12:36
%
It will be good for those servants whose master finds them watching when he 
comes. Truly I tell you, he will dress himself to serve, will have them recline 
at the table and will come and wait on them.
	--Luke 12:37
%
It will be good for those servants whose master finds them ready, even if he 
comes in the middle of the night or toward daybreak.
	--Luke 12:38
%
But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief 
was coming, he would not have let his house be broken into.
	--Luke 12:39
%
You also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do 
not expect him.”
	--Luke 12:40
%
Peter asked, “Lord, are you telling this parable to us, or to everyone?”
	--Luke 12:41
%
The Lord answered, “Who then is the faithful and wise manager, whom the 
master puts in charge of his servants to give them their food allowance at the 
proper time?
	--Luke 12:42
%
It will be good for that servant whom the master finds doing so when he returns.
	--Luke 12:43
%
Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions.
	--Luke 12:44
%
But suppose the servant says to himself, ‘My master is taking a long time in 
coming,’ and he then begins to beat the other servants, both men and women, 
and to eat and drink and get drunk.
	--Luke 12:45
%
The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and 
at an hour he is not aware of. He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place 
with the unbelievers.
	--Luke 12:46
%
“The servant who knows the master’s will and does not get ready or does not 
do what the master wants will be beaten with many blows.
	--Luke 12:47
%
But the one who does not know and does things deserving punishment will be 
beaten with few blows. From everyone who has been given much, much will be 
demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be 
asked.

“I have come to bring fire on the earth, and how I wish it were already 
kindled!

But I have a baptism to undergo, and what constraint I am under until it is 
completed!

%
Do you think I came to bring peace on earth? No, I tell you, but division.

%
From now on there will be five in one family divided against each other, three 
against two and two against three.
	--Luke 12:52
%
They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against 
daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and 
daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.”
	--Luke 12:53
%
He said to the crowd: “When you see a cloud rising in the west, immediately 
you say, ‘It’s going to rain,’ and it does.
	--Luke 12:54
%
And when the south wind blows, you say, ‘It’s going to be hot,’ and it is.
	--Luke 12:55
%
Hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky. 
How is it that you don’t know how to interpret this present time?

“Why don’t you judge for yourselves what is right?
	--Luke 12:57

As you are going with your adversary to the magistrate, try hard to be 
reconciled on the way, or your adversary may drag you off to the judge, and the 
judge turn you over to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison.

%
I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny.”
	--Luke 12:59
%
Now there were some present at that time who told Jesus about the Galileans 
whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.
	--Luke 13:1
%
Jesus answered, “Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than 
all the other Galileans because they suffered this way?
	--Luke 13:2
%
I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish.
	--Luke 13:3
%
Or those eighteen who died when the tower in Siloam fell on them—do you think 
they were more guilty than all the others living in Jerusalem?

I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish.”
	--Luke 13:5
%
Then he told this parable: “A man had a fig tree growing in his vineyard, and 
he went to look for fruit on it but did not find any.
	--Luke 13:6
%
So he said to the man who took care of the vineyard, ‘For three years now 
I’ve been coming to look for fruit on this fig tree and haven’t found any. 
Cut it down! Why should it use up the soil?’
	--Luke 13:7
%
“‘Sir,’ the man replied, ‘leave it alone for one more year, and I’ll 
dig around it and fertilize it.
	--Luke 13:8
%
If it bears fruit next year, fine! If not, then cut it down.’”
	--Luke 13:9
%
On a Sabbath Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues,
	--Luke 13:10
%
and a woman was there who had been crippled by a spirit for eighteen years. She 
was bent over and could not straighten up at all.
	--Luke 13:11
%
When Jesus saw her, he called her forward and said to her, “Woman, you are 
set free from your infirmity.”
	--Luke 13:12
%
Then he put his hands on her, and immediately she straightened up and praised 
God.
	--Luke 13:13
%
Indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, the synagogue leader said to 
the people, “There are six days for work. So come and be healed on those 
days, not on the Sabbath.”
	--Luke 13:14
%
The Lord answered him, “You hypocrites! Doesn’t each of you on the Sabbath 
untie your ox or donkey from the stall and lead it out to give it water?
	--Luke 13:15
%
Then should not this woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has kept bound 
for eighteen long years, be set free on the Sabbath day from what bound her?”
	--Luke 13:16
%
When he said this, all his opponents were humiliated, but the people were 
delighted with all the wonderful things he was doing.
	--Luke 13:17
%
Then Jesus asked, “What is the kingdom of God like? What shall I compare it 
to?
	--Luke 13:18
%
It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his garden. It grew 
and became a tree, and the birds perched in its branches.”
	--Luke 13:19
%
Again he asked, “What shall I compare the kingdom of God to?
	--Luke 13:20
%
It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds of flour 
until it worked all through the dough.”
	--Luke 13:21
%
Then Jesus went through the towns and villages, teaching as he made his way to 
Jerusalem.
	--Luke 13:22
%
Someone asked him, “Lord, are only a few people going to be saved?” He said 
to them,
	--Luke 13:23
%
“Make every effort to enter through the narrow door, because many, I tell 
you, will try to enter and will not be able to.
	--Luke 13:24
%
Once the owner of the house gets up and closes the door, you will stand outside 
knocking and pleading, ‘Sir, open the door for us.’ “But he will answer, 
‘I don’t know you or where you come from.’
	--Luke 13:25
%
“Then you will say, ‘We ate and drank with you, and you taught in our 
streets.’
	--Luke 13:26
%
“But he will reply, ‘I don’t know you or where you come from. Away from 
me, all you evildoers!’
	--Luke 13:27
%
“There will be weeping there, and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham, 
Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you yourselves 
thrown out.
	--Luke 13:28
%
People will come from east and west and north and south, and will take their 
places at the feast in the kingdom of God.
	--Luke 13:29
%
Indeed there are those who are last who will be first, and first who will be 
last.”
	--Luke 13:30
%
At that time some Pharisees came to Jesus and said to him, “Leave this place 
and go somewhere else. Herod wants to kill you.”
	--Luke 13:31
%
He replied, “Go tell that fox, ‘I will keep on driving out demons and 
healing people today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will reach my goal.’
	--Luke 13:32
%
In any case, I must press on today and tomorrow and the next day—for surely 
no prophet can die outside Jerusalem!
	--Luke 13:33
%
“Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, 
how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her 
chicks under her wings, and you were not willing.
	--Luke 13:34
%
Look, your house is left to you desolate. I tell you, you will not see me again 
until you say, ‘Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.’”
	--Luke 13:35
%
One Sabbath, when Jesus went to eat in the house of a prominent Pharisee, he 
was being carefully watched.
	--Luke 14:1
%
There in front of him was a man suffering from abnormal swelling of his body.
	--Luke 14:2
%
Jesus asked the Pharisees and experts in the law, “Is it lawful to heal on 
the Sabbath or not?”
	--Luke 14:3
%
But they remained silent. So taking hold of the man, he healed him and sent him 
on his way.
	--Luke 14:4
%
Then he asked them, “If one of you has a child or an ox that falls into a 
well on the Sabbath day, will you not immediately pull it out?”
	--Luke 14:5
%
And they had nothing to say.
	--Luke 14:6
%
When he noticed how the guests picked the places of honor at the table, he told 
them this parable:
	--Luke 14:7
%
“When someone invites you to a wedding feast, do not take the place of honor, 
for a person more distinguished than you may have been invited.
	--Luke 14:8
%
If so, the host who invited both of you will come and say to you, ‘Give this 
person your seat.’ Then, humiliated, you will have to take the least 
important place.
	--Luke 14:9
%
But when you are invited, take the lowest place, so that when your host comes, 
he will say to you, ‘Friend, move up to a better place.’ Then you will be 
honored in the presence of all the other guests.
	--Luke 14:10
%
For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble 
themselves will be exalted.”
	--Luke 14:11
%
Then Jesus said to his host, “When you give a luncheon or dinner, do not 
invite your friends, your brothers or sisters, your relatives, or your rich 
neighbors; if you do, they may invite you back and so you will be repaid.
	--Luke 14:12
%
But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind,
	--Luke 14:13
%
and you will be blessed. Although they cannot repay you, you will be repaid at 
the resurrection of the righteous.”
	--Luke 14:14
%
When one of those at the table with him heard this, he said to Jesus, 
“Blessed is the one who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God.”
	--Luke 14:15
%
Jesus replied: “A certain man was preparing a great banquet and invited many 
guests.
	--Luke 14:16
%
At the time of the banquet he sent his servant to tell those who had been 
invited, ‘Come, for everything is now ready.’
	--Luke 14:17
%
“But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said, ‘I have just 
bought a field, and I must go and see it. Please excuse me.’
	--Luke 14:18
%
“Another said, ‘I have just bought five yoke of oxen, and I’m on my way 
to try them out. Please excuse me.’
	--Luke 14:19
%
“Still another said, ‘I just got married, so I can’t come.’
	--Luke 14:20
%
“The servant came back and reported this to his master. Then the owner of the 
house became angry and ordered his servant, ‘Go out quickly into the streets 
and alleys of the town and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind and the 
lame.’
	--Luke 14:21
%
“‘Sir,’ the servant said, ‘what you ordered has been done, but there is 
still room.’
	--Luke 14:22
%
“Then the master told his servant, ‘Go out to the roads and country lanes 
and compel them to come in, so that my house will be full.
	--Luke 14:23
%
I tell you, not one of those who were invited will get a taste of my 
banquet.’”
	--Luke 14:24
%
Large crowds were traveling with Jesus, and turning to them he said:
	--Luke 14:25
%
“If anyone comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and 
children, brothers and sisters—yes, even their own life—such a person 
cannot be my disciple.
	--Luke 14:26
%
And whoever does not carry their cross and follow me cannot be my disciple.
	--Luke 14:27
%
“Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Won’t you first sit down and 
estimate the cost to see if you have enough money to complete it?
	--Luke 14:28
%
For if you lay the foundation and are not able to finish it, everyone who sees 
it will ridicule you,
	--Luke 14:29
%
saying, ‘This person began to build and wasn’t able to finish.’
	--Luke 14:30
%
“Or suppose a king is about to go to war against another king. Won’t he 
first sit down and consider whether he is able with ten thousand men to oppose 
the one coming against him with twenty thousand?
	--Luke 14:31
%
If he is not able, he will send a delegation while the other is still a long 
way off and will ask for terms of peace.
	--Luke 14:32
%
In the same way, those of you who do not give up everything you have cannot be 
my disciples.
	--Luke 14:33
%
“Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again?
	--Luke 14:34
%
It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile; it is thrown out. 
“Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear.”
	--Luke 14:35
%
Now the tax collectors and sinners were all gathering around to hear Jesus.
	--Luke 15:1
%
But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered, “This man welcomes 
sinners and eats with them.”
	--Luke 15:2
%
Then Jesus told them this parable:
	--Luke 15:3
%
“Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Doesn’t he 
leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he 
finds it?
	--Luke 15:4
%
And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders
	--Luke 15:5
%
and goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says, 
‘Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.’
	--Luke 15:6
%
I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one 
sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to 
repent.
	--Luke 15:7
%
“Or suppose a woman has ten silver coins and loses one. Doesn’t she light a 
lamp, sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it?
	--Luke 15:8
%
And when she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors together and says, 
‘Rejoice with me; I have found my lost coin.’
	--Luke 15:9
%
In the same way, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels 
of God over one sinner who repents.”
	--Luke 15:10
%
Jesus continued: “There was a man who had two sons.
	--Luke 15:11
%
The younger one said to his father, ‘Father, give me my share of the 
estate.’ So he divided his property between them.
	--Luke 15:12
%
“Not long after that, the younger son got together all he had, set off for a 
distant country and there squandered his wealth in wild living.
	--Luke 15:13
%
After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine in that whole country, 
and he began to be in need.
	--Luke 15:14
%
So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him to 
his fields to feed pigs.
	--Luke 15:15
%
He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no 
one gave him anything.
	--Luke 15:16
%
“When he came to his senses, he said, ‘How many of my father’s hired 
servants have food to spare, and here I am starving to death!
	--Luke 15:17
%
I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned 
against heaven and against you.
	--Luke 15:18
%
I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired 
servants.’
	--Luke 15:19
%
So he got up and went to his father. “But while he was still a long way off, 
his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, 
threw his arms around him and kissed him.
	--Luke 15:20
%
“The son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and against 
you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’
	--Luke 15:21
%
“But the father said to his servants, ‘Quick! Bring the best robe and put 
it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.
	--Luke 15:22
%
Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let’s have a feast and celebrate.
	--Luke 15:23
%
For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’ 
So they began to celebrate.
	--Luke 15:24
%
“Meanwhile, the older son was in the field. When he came near the house, he 
heard music and dancing.
	--Luke 15:25
%
So he called one of the servants and asked him what was going on.
	--Luke 15:26
%
‘Your brother has come,’ he replied, ‘and your father has killed the 
fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.’
	--Luke 15:27
%
“The older brother became angry and refused to go in. So his father went out 
and pleaded with him.
	--Luke 15:28
%
But he answered his father, ‘Look! All these years I’ve been slaving for 
you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so 
I could celebrate with my friends.
	--Luke 15:29
%
But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes 
comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him!’
	--Luke 15:30
%
“‘My son,’ the father said, ‘you are always with me, and everything I 
have is yours.
	--Luke 15:31
%
But we had to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and 
is alive again; he was lost and is found.’”
	--Luke 15:32
%
Jesus told his disciples: “There was a rich man whose manager was accused of 
wasting his possessions.
	--Luke 16:1
%
So he called him in and asked him, ‘What is this I hear about you? Give an 
account of your management, because you cannot be manager any longer.’
	--Luke 16:2
%
“The manager said to himself, ‘What shall I do now? My master is taking 
away my job. I’m not strong enough to dig, and I’m ashamed to beg—
	--Luke 16:3
%
I know what I’ll do so that, when I lose my job here, people will welcome me 
into their houses.’
	--Luke 16:4
%
“So he called in each one of his master’s debtors. He asked the first, 
‘How much do you owe my master?’
	--Luke 16:5
%
“‘Nine hundred gallons of olive oil,’ he replied. “The manager told 
him, ‘Take your bill, sit down quickly, and make it four hundred and fifty.’
	--Luke 16:6
%
“Then he asked the second, ‘And how much do you owe?’ “‘A thousand 
bushels of wheat,’ he replied. “He told him, ‘Take your bill and make it 
eight hundred.’
	--Luke 16:7
%
“The master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly. 
For the people of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind 
than are the people of the light.
	--Luke 16:8
%
I tell you, use worldly wealth to gain friends for yourselves, so that when it 
is gone, you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings.
	--Luke 16:9
%
“Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and 
whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much.
	--Luke 16:10
%
So if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth, who will trust 
you with true riches?
	--Luke 16:11
%
And if you have not been trustworthy with someone else’s property, who will 
give you property of your own?
	--Luke 16:12
%
“No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the 
other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot 
serve both God and money.”
	--Luke 16:13
%
The Pharisees, who loved money, heard all this and were sneering at Jesus.
	--Luke 16:14
%
He said to them, “You are the ones who justify yourselves in the eyes of 
others, but God knows your hearts. What people value highly is detestable in 
God’s sight.
	--Luke 16:15
%
“The Law and the Prophets were proclaimed until John. Since that time, the 
good news of the kingdom of God is being preached, and everyone is forcing 
their way into it.
	--Luke 16:16
%
It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a 
pen to drop out of the Law.
	--Luke 16:17
%
“Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery, and 
the man who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
	--Luke 16:18
%
“There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in 
luxury every day.
	--Luke 16:19
%
At his gate was laid a beggar named Lazarus, covered with sores
	--Luke 16:20
%
and longing to eat what fell from the rich man’s table. Even the dogs came 
and licked his sores.
	--Luke 16:21
%
“The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham’s 
side. The rich man also died and was buried.
	--Luke 16:22
%
In Hades, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with 
Lazarus by his side.
	--Luke 16:23
%
So he called to him, ‘Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip 
the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in 
this fire.’
	--Luke 16:24
%
“But Abraham replied, ‘Son, remember that in your lifetime you received 
your good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted 
here and you are in agony.
	--Luke 16:25
%
And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been set in place, 
so that those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over 
from there to us.’
	--Luke 16:26
%
“He answered, ‘Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my family,
	--Luke 16:27
%
for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to 
this place of torment.’
	--Luke 16:28
%
“Abraham replied, ‘They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to 
them.’
	--Luke 16:29
%
“‘No, father Abraham,’ he said, ‘but if someone from the dead goes to 
them, they will repent.’
	--Luke 16:30
%
“He said to him, ‘If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they 
will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.’”
	--Luke 16:31
%
Jesus said to his disciples: “Things that cause people to stumble are bound 
to come, but woe to anyone through whom they come.
	--Luke 17:1
%
It would be better for them to be thrown into the sea with a millstone tied 
around their neck than to cause one of these little ones to stumble.
	--Luke 17:2
%
So watch yourselves. “If your brother or sister sins against you, rebuke 
them; and if they repent, forgive them.
	--Luke 17:3
%
Even if they sin against you seven times in a day and seven times come back to 
you saying ‘I repent,’ you must forgive them.”
	--Luke 17:4
%
The apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith!”
	--Luke 17:5
%
He replied, “If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to 
this mulberry tree, ‘Be uprooted and planted in the sea,’ and it will obey 
you.
	--Luke 17:6
%
“Suppose one of you has a servant plowing or looking after the sheep. Will he 
say to the servant when he comes in from the field, ‘Come along now and sit 
down to eat’?
	--Luke 17:7
%
Won’t he rather say, ‘Prepare my supper, get yourself ready and wait on me 
while I eat and drink; after that you may eat and drink’?
	--Luke 17:8
%
Will he thank the servant because he did what he was told to do?
	--Luke 17:9
%
So you also, when you have done everything you were told to do, should say, 
‘We are unworthy servants; we have only done our duty.’”
	--Luke 17:10
%
Now on his way to Jerusalem, Jesus traveled along the border between Samaria 
and Galilee.
	--Luke 17:11
%
As he was going into a village, ten men who had leprosy met him. They stood at 
a distance
	--Luke 17:12
%
and called out in a loud voice, “Jesus, Master, have pity on us!”
	--Luke 17:13
%
When he saw them, he said, “Go, show yourselves to the priests.” And as 
they went, they were cleansed.
	--Luke 17:14
%
One of them, when he saw he was healed, came back, praising God in a loud voice.
	--Luke 17:15
%
He threw himself at Jesus’ feet and thanked him—and he was a Samaritan.
	--Luke 17:16
%
Jesus asked, “Were not all ten cleansed? Where are the other nine?
	--Luke 17:17
%
Has no one returned to give praise to God except this foreigner?”
	--Luke 17:18
%
Then he said to him, “Rise and go; your faith has made you well.”
	--Luke 17:19
%
Once, on being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, Jesus 
replied, “The coming of the kingdom of God is not something that can be 
observed,
	--Luke 17:20
%
nor will people say, ‘Here it is,’ or ‘There it is,’ because the 
kingdom of God is in your midst.”
	--Luke 17:21
%
Then he said to his disciples, “The time is coming when you will long to see 
one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it.
	--Luke 17:22
%
People will tell you, ‘There he is!’ or ‘Here he is!’ Do not go running 
off after them.
	--Luke 17:23
%
For the Son of Man in his day will be like the lightning, which flashes and 
lights up the sky from one end to the other.
	--Luke 17:24
%
But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.
	--Luke 17:25
%
“Just as it was in the days of Noah, so also will it be in the days of the 
Son of Man.
	--Luke 17:26
%
People were eating, drinking, marrying and being given in marriage up to the 
day Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came and destroyed them all.
	--Luke 17:27
%
“It was the same in the days of Lot. People were eating and drinking, buying 
and selling, planting and building.
	--Luke 17:28
%
But the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and 
destroyed them all.
	--Luke 17:29
%
“It will be just like this on the day the Son of Man is revealed.
	--Luke 17:30
%
On that day no one who is on the housetop, with possessions inside, should go 
down to get them. Likewise, no one in the field should go back for anything.
	--Luke 17:31
%
Remember Lot’s wife!
	--Luke 17:32
%
Whoever tries to keep their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life 
will preserve it.
	--Luke 17:33
%
I tell you, on that night two people will be in one bed; one will be taken and 
the other left.
	--Luke 17:34
%
Two women will be grinding grain together; one will be taken and the other 
left.”
	--Luke 17:35
%

	--Luke 17:36
%
“Where, Lord?” they asked. He replied, “Where there is a dead body, there 
the vultures will gather.”
	--Luke 17:37
%
Then Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always 
pray and not give up.
	--Luke 18:1
%
He said: “In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor 
cared what people thought.
	--Luke 18:2
%
And there was a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea, 
‘Grant me justice against my adversary.’
	--Luke 18:3
%
“For some time he refused. But finally he said to himself, ‘Even though I 
don’t fear God or care what people think,
	--Luke 18:4
%
yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice, so 
that she won’t eventually come and attack me!’”
	--Luke 18:5
%
And the Lord said, “Listen to what the unjust judge says.
	--Luke 18:6
%
And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him 
day and night? Will he keep putting them off?
	--Luke 18:7
%
I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when the 
Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?”
	--Luke 18:8
%
To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on 
everyone else, Jesus told this parable:
	--Luke 18:9
%
“Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax 
collector.
	--Luke 18:10
%
The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed: ‘God, I thank you that I am not 
like other people—robbers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax 
collector.
	--Luke 18:11
%
I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.’
	--Luke 18:12
%
“But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to 
heaven, but beat his breast and said, ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner.’
	--Luke 18:13
%
“I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before 
God. For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble 
themselves will be exalted.”
	--Luke 18:14
%
People were also bringing babies to Jesus for him to place his hands on them. 
When the disciples saw this, they rebuked them.
	--Luke 18:15
%
But Jesus called the children to him and said, “Let the little children come 
to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.
	--Luke 18:16
%
Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little 
child will never enter it.”
	--Luke 18:17
%
A certain ruler asked him, “Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal 
life?”
	--Luke 18:18
%
“Why do you call me good?” Jesus answered. “No one is good—except God 
alone.
	--Luke 18:19
%
You know the commandments: ‘You shall not commit adultery, you shall not 
murder, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, honor your 
father and mother.’”
	--Luke 18:20
%
“All these I have kept since I was a boy,” he said.
	--Luke 18:21
%
When Jesus heard this, he said to him, “You still lack one thing. Sell 
everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. 
Then come, follow me.”
	--Luke 18:22
%
When he heard this, he became very sad, because he was very wealthy.
	--Luke 18:23
%
Jesus looked at him and said, “How hard it is for the rich to enter the 
kingdom of God!
	--Luke 18:24
%
Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for 
someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.”
	--Luke 18:25
%
Those who heard this asked, “Who then can be saved?”
	--Luke 18:26
%
Jesus replied, “What is impossible with man is possible with God.”
	--Luke 18:27
%
Peter said to him, “We have left all we had to follow you!”
	--Luke 18:28
%
“Truly I tell you,” Jesus said to them, “no one who has left home or wife 
or brothers or sisters or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God
	--Luke 18:29
%
will fail to receive many times as much in this age, and in the age to come 
eternal life.”
	--Luke 18:30
%
Jesus took the Twelve aside and told them, “We are going up to Jerusalem, and 
everything that is written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be 
fulfilled.
	--Luke 18:31
%
He will be delivered over to the Gentiles. They will mock him, insult him and 
spit on him;
	--Luke 18:32
%
they will flog him and kill him. On the third day he will rise again.”
	--Luke 18:33
%
The disciples did not understand any of this. Its meaning was hidden from them, 
and they did not know what he was talking about.
	--Luke 18:34
%
As Jesus approached Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging.
	--Luke 18:35
%
When he heard the crowd going by, he asked what was happening.
	--Luke 18:36
%
They told him, “Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.”
	--Luke 18:37
%
He called out, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”
	--Luke 18:38
%
Those who led the way rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all 
the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”
	--Luke 18:39
%
Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to him. When he came near, 
Jesus asked him,
	--Luke 18:40
%
“What do you want me to do for you?” “Lord, I want to see,” he replied.
	--Luke 18:41
%
Jesus said to him, “Receive your sight; your faith has healed you.”
	--Luke 18:42
%
Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus, praising God. When all 
the people saw it, they also praised God.
	--Luke 18:43
%
Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through.
	--Luke 19:1
%
A man was there by the name of Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector and was 
wealthy.
	--Luke 19:2
%
He wanted to see who Jesus was, but because he was short he could not see over 
the crowd.
	--Luke 19:3
%
So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore-fig tree to see him, since Jesus was 
coming that way.
	--Luke 19:4
%
When Jesus reached the spot, he looked up and said to him, “Zacchaeus, come 
down immediately. I must stay at your house today.”
	--Luke 19:5
%
So he came down at once and welcomed him gladly.
	--Luke 19:6
%
All the people saw this and began to mutter, “He has gone to be the guest of 
a sinner.”
	--Luke 19:7
%
But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, “Look, Lord! Here and now I give 
half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anybody out of 
anything, I will pay back four times the amount.”
	--Luke 19:8
%
Jesus said to him, “Today salvation has come to this house, because this man, 
too, is a son of Abraham.
	--Luke 19:9
%
For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.”
	--Luke 19:10
%
While they were listening to this, he went on to tell them a parable, because 
he was near Jerusalem and the people thought that the kingdom of God was going 
to appear at once.
	--Luke 19:11
%
He said: “A man of noble birth went to a distant country to have himself 
appointed king and then to return.
	--Luke 19:12
%
So he called ten of his servants and gave them ten minas. ‘Put this money to 
work,’ he said, ‘until I come back.’
	--Luke 19:13
%
“But his subjects hated him and sent a delegation after him to say, ‘We 
don’t want this man to be our king.’
	--Luke 19:14
%
“He was made king, however, and returned home. Then he sent for the servants 
to whom he had given the money, in order to find out what they had gained with 
it.
	--Luke 19:15
%
“The first one came and said, ‘Sir, your mina has earned ten more.’
	--Luke 19:16
%
“‘Well done, my good servant!’ his master replied. ‘Because you have 
been trustworthy in a very small matter, take charge of ten cities.’
	--Luke 19:17
%
“The second came and said, ‘Sir, your mina has earned five more.’
	--Luke 19:18
%
“His master answered, ‘You take charge of five cities.’
	--Luke 19:19
%
“Then another servant came and said, ‘Sir, here is your mina; I have kept 
it laid away in a piece of cloth.
	--Luke 19:20
%
I was afraid of you, because you are a hard man. You take out what you did not 
put in and reap what you did not sow.’
	--Luke 19:21
%
“His master replied, ‘I will judge you by your own words, you wicked 
servant! You knew, did you, that I am a hard man, taking out what I did not put 
in, and reaping what I did not sow?
	--Luke 19:22
%
Why then didn’t you put my money on deposit, so that when I came back, I 
could have collected it with interest?’
	--Luke 19:23
%
“Then he said to those standing by, ‘Take his mina away from him and give 
it to the one who has ten minas.’
	--Luke 19:24
%
“‘Sir,’ they said, ‘he already has ten!’
	--Luke 19:25
%
“He replied, ‘I tell you that to everyone who has, more will be given, but 
as for the one who has nothing, even what they have will be taken away.
	--Luke 19:26
%
But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them—bring them 
here and kill them in front of me.’”
	--Luke 19:27
%
After Jesus had said this, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.
	--Luke 19:28
%
As he approached Bethphage and Bethany at the hill called the Mount of Olives, 
he sent two of his disciples, saying to them,
	--Luke 19:29
%
“Go to the village ahead of you, and as you enter it, you will find a colt 
tied there, which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here.
	--Luke 19:30
%
If anyone asks you, ‘Why are you untying it?’ say, ‘The Lord needs 
it.’”
	--Luke 19:31
%
Those who were sent ahead went and found it just as he had told them.
	--Luke 19:32
%
As they were untying the colt, its owners asked them, “Why are you untying 
the colt?”
	--Luke 19:33
%
They replied, “The Lord needs it.”
	--Luke 19:34
%
They brought it to Jesus, threw their cloaks on the colt and put Jesus on it.
	--Luke 19:35
%
As he went along, people spread their cloaks on the road.
	--Luke 19:36
%
When he came near the place where the road goes down the Mount of Olives, the 
whole crowd of disciples began joyfully to praise God in loud voices for all 
the miracles they had seen:
	--Luke 19:37
%
“Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord!” “Peace in heaven 
and glory in the highest!”
	--Luke 19:38
%
Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus, “Teacher, rebuke your 
disciples!”
	--Luke 19:39
%
“I tell you,” he replied, “if they keep quiet, the stones will cry out.”
	--Luke 19:40
%
As he approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it
	--Luke 19:41
%
and said, “If you, even you, had only known on this day what would bring you 
peace—but now it is hidden from your eyes.
	--Luke 19:42
%
The days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against 
you and encircle you and hem you in on every side.
	--Luke 19:43
%
They will dash you to the ground, you and the children within your walls. They 
will not leave one stone on another, because you did not recognize the time of 
God’s coming to you.”
	--Luke 19:44
%
When Jesus entered the temple courts, he began to drive out those who were 
selling.
	--Luke 19:45
%
“It is written,” he said to them, “‘My house will be a house of 
prayer’; but you have made it ‘a den of robbers.’”
	--Luke 19:46
%
Every day he was teaching at the temple. But the chief priests, the teachers of 
the law and the leaders among the people were trying to kill him.
	--Luke 19:47
%
Yet they could not find any way to do it, because all the people hung on his 
words.
	--Luke 19:48
%
One day as Jesus was teaching the people in the temple courts and proclaiming 
the good news, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, together with the 
elders, came up to him.
	--Luke 20:1
%
“Tell us by what authority you are doing these things,” they said. “Who 
gave you this authority?”
	--Luke 20:2
%
He replied, “I will also ask you a question. Tell me:
	--Luke 20:3
%
John’s baptism—was it from heaven, or of human origin?”
	--Luke 20:4
%
They discussed it among themselves and said, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ 
he will ask, ‘Why didn’t you believe him?’
	--Luke 20:5
%
But if we say, ‘Of human origin,’ all the people will stone us, because 
they are persuaded that John was a prophet.”
	--Luke 20:6
%
So they answered, “We don’t know where it was from.”
	--Luke 20:7
%
Jesus said, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these 
things.”
	--Luke 20:8
%
He went on to tell the people this parable: “A man planted a vineyard, rented 
it to some farmers and went away for a long time.
	--Luke 20:9
%
At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants so they would give him some of 
the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat him and sent him away 
empty-handed.
	--Luke 20:10
%
He sent another servant, but that one also they beat and treated shamefully and 
sent away empty-handed.
	--Luke 20:11
%
He sent still a third, and they wounded him and threw him out.
	--Luke 20:12
%
“Then the owner of the vineyard said, ‘What shall I do? I will send my son, 
whom I love; perhaps they will respect him.’
	--Luke 20:13
%
“But when the tenants saw him, they talked the matter over. ‘This is the 
heir,’ they said. ‘Let’s kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’
	--Luke 20:14
%
So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. “What then will the 
owner of the vineyard do to them?
	--Luke 20:15
%
He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others.” When 
the people heard this, they said, “God forbid!”
	--Luke 20:16
%
Jesus looked directly at them and asked, “Then what is the meaning of that 
which is written: “‘The stone the builders rejected has become the 
cornerstone’?
	--Luke 20:17
%
Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; anyone on whom it 
falls will be crushed.”
	--Luke 20:18
%
The teachers of the law and the chief priests looked for a way to arrest him 
immediately, because they knew he had spoken this parable against them. But 
they were afraid of the people.
	--Luke 20:19
%
Keeping a close watch on him, they sent spies, who pretended to be sincere. 
They hoped to catch Jesus in something he said, so that they might hand him 
over to the power and authority of the governor.
	--Luke 20:20
%
So the spies questioned him: “Teacher, we know that you speak and teach what 
is right, and that you do not show partiality but teach the way of God in 
accordance with the truth.
	--Luke 20:21
%
Is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”
	--Luke 20:22
%
He saw through their duplicity and said to them,
	--Luke 20:23
%
“Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription are on it?” 
“Caesar’s,” they replied.
	--Luke 20:24
%
He said to them, “Then give back to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God 
what is God’s.”
	--Luke 20:25
%
They were unable to trap him in what he had said there in public. And 
astonished by his answer, they became silent.
	--Luke 20:26
%
Some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Jesus with a 
question.
	--Luke 20:27
%
“Teacher,” they said, “Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies 
and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and raise up 
offspring for his brother.
	--Luke 20:28
%
Now there were seven brothers. The first one married a woman and died childless.
	--Luke 20:29
%
The second
	--Luke 20:30
%
and then the third married her, and in the same way the seven died, leaving no 
children.
	--Luke 20:31
%
Finally, the woman died too.
	--Luke 20:32
%
Now then, at the resurrection whose wife will she be, since the seven were 
married to her?”
	--Luke 20:33
%
Jesus replied, “The people of this age marry and are given in marriage.
	--Luke 20:34
%
But those who are considered worthy of taking part in the age to come and in 
the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage,
	--Luke 20:35
%
and they can no longer die; for they are like the angels. They are God’s 
children, since they are children of the resurrection.
	--Luke 20:36
%
But in the account of the burning bush, even Moses showed that the dead rise, 
for he calls the Lord ‘the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God 
of Jacob.’
	--Luke 20:37
%
He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to him all are alive.”
	--Luke 20:38
%
Some of the teachers of the law responded, “Well said, teacher!”
	--Luke 20:39
%
And no one dared to ask him any more questions.
	--Luke 20:40
%
Then Jesus said to them, “Why is it said that the Messiah is the son of David?
	--Luke 20:41
%
David himself declares in the Book of Psalms: “‘The Lord said to my Lord: 
“Sit at my right hand
	--Luke 20:42
%
until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.”’
	--Luke 20:43
%
David calls him ‘Lord.’ How then can he be his son?”
	--Luke 20:44
%
While all the people were listening, Jesus said to his disciples,
	--Luke 20:45
%
“Beware of the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes 
and love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and have the most 
important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets.
	--Luke 20:46
%
They devour widows’ houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. These men 
will be punished most severely.”
	--Luke 20:47
%
As Jesus looked up, he saw the rich putting their gifts into the temple 
treasury.
	--Luke 21:1
%
He also saw a poor widow put in two very small copper coins.
	--Luke 21:2
%
“Truly I tell you,” he said, “this poor widow has put in more than all 
the others.
	--Luke 21:3
%
All these people gave their gifts out of their wealth; but she out of her 
poverty put in all she had to live on.”
	--Luke 21:4
%
Some of his disciples were remarking about how the temple was adorned with 
beautiful stones and with gifts dedicated to God. But Jesus said,
	--Luke 21:5
%
“As for what you see here, the time will come when not one stone will be left 
on another; every one of them will be thrown down.”
	--Luke 21:6
%
“Teacher,” they asked, “when will these things happen? And what will be 
the sign that they are about to take place?”
	--Luke 21:7
%
He replied: “Watch out that you are not deceived. For many will come in my 
name, claiming, ‘I am he,’ and, ‘The time is near.’ Do not follow them.
	--Luke 21:8
%
When you hear of wars and uprisings, do not be frightened. These things must 
happen first, but the end will not come right away.”
	--Luke 21:9
%
Then he said to them: “Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against 
kingdom.
	--Luke 21:10
%
There will be great earthquakes, famines and pestilences in various places, and 
fearful events and great signs from heaven.
	--Luke 21:11
%
“But before all this, they will seize you and persecute you. They will hand 
you over to synagogues and put you in prison, and you will be brought before 
kings and governors, and all on account of my name.
	--Luke 21:12
%
And so you will bear testimony to me.
	--Luke 21:13
%
But make up your mind not to worry beforehand how you will defend yourselves.
	--Luke 21:14
%
For I will give you words and wisdom that none of your adversaries will be able 
to resist or contradict.
	--Luke 21:15
%
You will be betrayed even by parents, brothers and sisters, relatives and 
friends, and they will put some of you to death.
	--Luke 21:16
%
Everyone will hate you because of me.
	--Luke 21:17
%
But not a hair of your head will perish.
	--Luke 21:18
%
Stand firm, and you will win life.
	--Luke 21:19
%
“When you see Jerusalem being surrounded by armies, you will know that its 
desolation is near.
	--Luke 21:20
%
Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, let those in the city 
get out, and let those in the country not enter the city.
	--Luke 21:21
%
For this is the time of punishment in fulfillment of all that has been written.
	--Luke 21:22
%
How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers! 
There will be great distress in the land and wrath against this people.
	--Luke 21:23
%
They will fall by the sword and will be taken as prisoners to all the nations. 
Jerusalem will be trampled on by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles 
are fulfilled.
	--Luke 21:24
%
“There will be signs in the sun, moon and stars. On the earth, nations will 
be in anguish and perplexity at the roaring and tossing of the sea.
	--Luke 21:25
%
People will faint from terror, apprehensive of what is coming on the world, for 
the heavenly bodies will be shaken.
	--Luke 21:26
%
At that time they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and 
great glory.
	--Luke 21:27
%
When these things begin to take place, stand up and lift up your heads, because 
your redemption is drawing near.”
	--Luke 21:28
%
He told them this parable: “Look at the fig tree and all the trees.
	--Luke 21:29
%
When they sprout leaves, you can see for yourselves and know that summer is 
near.
	--Luke 21:30
%
Even so, when you see these things happening, you know that the kingdom of God 
is near.
	--Luke 21:31
%
“Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all 
these things have happened.
	--Luke 21:32
%
Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.
	--Luke 21:33
%
“Be careful, or your hearts will be weighed down with carousing, drunkenness 
and the anxieties of life, and that day will close on you suddenly like a trap.
	--Luke 21:34
%
For it will come on all those who live on the face of the whole earth.
	--Luke 21:35
%
Be always on the watch, and pray that you may be able to escape all that is 
about to happen, and that you may be able to stand before the Son of Man.”
	--Luke 21:36
%
Each day Jesus was teaching at the temple, and each evening he went out to 
spend the night on the hill called the Mount of Olives,
	--Luke 21:37
%
and all the people came early in the morning to hear him at the temple.
	--Luke 21:38
%
Now the Festival of Unleavened Bread, called the Passover, was approaching,
	--Luke 22:1
%
and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for some way to 
get rid of Jesus, for they were afraid of the people.
	--Luke 22:2
%
Then Satan entered Judas, called Iscariot, one of the Twelve.
	--Luke 22:3
%
And Judas went to the chief priests and the officers of the temple guard and 
discussed with them how he might betray Jesus.
	--Luke 22:4
%
They were delighted and agreed to give him money.
	--Luke 22:5
%
He consented, and watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them when no 
crowd was present.
	--Luke 22:6
%
Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb had to be 
sacrificed.
	--Luke 22:7
%
Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, “Go and make preparations for us to eat 
the Passover.”
	--Luke 22:8
%
“Where do you want us to prepare for it?” they asked.
	--Luke 22:9
%
He replied, “As you enter the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet 
you. Follow him to the house that he enters,
	--Luke 22:10
%
and say to the owner of the house, ‘The Teacher asks: Where is the guest 
room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?’
	--Luke 22:11
%
He will show you a large room upstairs, all furnished. Make preparations 
there.”
	--Luke 22:12
%
They left and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the 
Passover.
	--Luke 22:13
%
When the hour came, Jesus and his apostles reclined at the table.
	--Luke 22:14
%
And he said to them, “I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you 
before I suffer.
	--Luke 22:15
%
For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it finds fulfillment in the 
kingdom of God.”
	--Luke 22:16
%
After taking the cup, he gave thanks and said, “Take this and divide it among 
you.
	--Luke 22:17
%
For I tell you I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until the 
kingdom of God comes.”
	--Luke 22:18
%
And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, 
“This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.”
	--Luke 22:19
%
In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, “This cup is the 
new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.
	--Luke 22:20
%
But the hand of him who is going to betray me is with mine on the table.
	--Luke 22:21
%
The Son of Man will go as it has been decreed. But woe to that man who betrays 
him!”
	--Luke 22:22
%
They began to question among themselves which of them it might be who would do 
this.
	--Luke 22:23
%
A dispute also arose among them as to which of them was considered to be 
greatest.
	--Luke 22:24
%
Jesus said to them, “The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those 
who exercise authority over them call themselves Benefactors.
	--Luke 22:25
%
But you are not to be like that. Instead, the greatest among you should be like 
the youngest, and the one who rules like the one who serves.
	--Luke 22:26
%
For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it 
not the one who is at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.
	--Luke 22:27
%
You are those who have stood by me in my trials.
	--Luke 22:28
%
And I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred one on me,
	--Luke 22:29
%
so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones, 
judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
	--Luke 22:30
%
“Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift all of you as wheat.
	--Luke 22:31
%
But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail. And when you 
have turned back, strengthen your brothers.”
	--Luke 22:32
%
But he replied, “Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death.”
	--Luke 22:33
%
Jesus answered, “I tell you, Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will 
deny three times that you know me.”
	--Luke 22:34
%
Then Jesus asked them, “When I sent you without purse, bag or sandals, did 
you lack anything?” “Nothing,” they answered.
	--Luke 22:35
%
He said to them, “But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and 
if you don’t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.
	--Luke 22:36
%
It is written: ‘And he was numbered with the transgressors’; and I tell you 
that this must be fulfilled in me. Yes, what is written about me is reaching 
its fulfillment.”
	--Luke 22:37
%
The disciples said, “See, Lord, here are two swords.” “That’s 
enough!” he replied.
	--Luke 22:38
%
Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and his disciples followed him.
	--Luke 22:39
%
On reaching the place, he said to them, “Pray that you will not fall into 
temptation.”
	--Luke 22:40
%
He withdrew about a stone’s throw beyond them, knelt down and prayed,
	--Luke 22:41
%
“Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but 
yours be done.”
	--Luke 22:42
%
An angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him.
	--Luke 22:43
%
And being in anguish, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was like drops of 
blood falling to the ground.
	--Luke 22:44
%
When he rose from prayer and went back to the disciples, he found them asleep, 
exhausted from sorrow.
	--Luke 22:45
%
“Why are you sleeping?” he asked them. “Get up and pray so that you will 
not fall into temptation.”
	--Luke 22:46
%
While he was still speaking a crowd came up, and the man who was called Judas, 
one of the Twelve, was leading them. He approached Jesus to kiss him,
	--Luke 22:47
%
but Jesus asked him, “Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?”
	--Luke 22:48
%
When Jesus’ followers saw what was going to happen, they said, “Lord, 
should we strike with our swords?”
	--Luke 22:49
%
And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right 
ear.
	--Luke 22:50
%
But Jesus answered, “No more of this!” And he touched the man’s ear and 
healed him.
	--Luke 22:51
%
Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple guard, and the 
elders, who had come for him, “Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come 
with swords and clubs?
	--Luke 22:52
%
Every day I was with you in the temple courts, and you did not lay a hand on 
me. But this is your hour—when darkness reigns.”
	--Luke 22:53
%
Then seizing him, they led him away and took him into the house of the high 
priest. Peter followed at a distance.
	--Luke 22:54
%
And when some there had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had 
sat down together, Peter sat down with them.
	--Luke 22:55
%
A servant girl saw him seated there in the firelight. She looked closely at him 
and said, “This man was with him.”
	--Luke 22:56
%
But he denied it. “Woman, I don’t know him,” he said.
	--Luke 22:57
%
A little later someone else saw him and said, “You also are one of them.” 
“Man, I am not!” Peter replied.
	--Luke 22:58
%
About an hour later another asserted, “Certainly this fellow was with him, 
for he is a Galilean.”
	--Luke 22:59
%
Peter replied, “Man, I don’t know what you’re talking about!” Just as 
he was speaking, the rooster crowed.
	--Luke 22:60
%
The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word 
the Lord had spoken to him: “Before the rooster crows today, you will disown 
me three times.”
	--Luke 22:61
%
And he went outside and wept bitterly.
	--Luke 22:62
%
The men who were guarding Jesus began mocking and beating him.
	--Luke 22:63
%
They blindfolded him and demanded, “Prophesy! Who hit you?”
	--Luke 22:64
%
And they said many other insulting things to him.
	--Luke 22:65
%
At daybreak the council of the elders of the people, both the chief priests and 
the teachers of the law, met together, and Jesus was led before them.
	--Luke 22:66
%
“If you are the Messiah,” they said, “tell us.” Jesus answered, “If I 
tell you, you will not believe me,
	--Luke 22:67
%
and if I asked you, you would not answer.
	--Luke 22:68
%
But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty 
God.”
	--Luke 22:69
%
They all asked, “Are you then the Son of God?” He replied, “You say that 
I am.”
	--Luke 22:70
%
Then they said, “Why do we need any more testimony? We have heard it from his 
own lips.”
	--Luke 22:71
%
Then the whole assembly rose and led him off to Pilate.
	--Luke 23:1
%
And they began to accuse him, saying, “We have found this man subverting our 
nation. He opposes payment of taxes to Caesar and claims to be Messiah, a 
king.”
	--Luke 23:2
%
So Pilate asked Jesus, “Are you the king of the Jews?” “You have said 
so,” Jesus replied.
	--Luke 23:3
%
Then Pilate announced to the chief priests and the crowd, “I find no basis 
for a charge against this man.”
	--Luke 23:4
%
But they insisted, “He stirs up the people all over Judea by his teaching. He 
started in Galilee and has come all the way here.”
	--Luke 23:5
%
On hearing this, Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean.
	--Luke 23:6
%
When he learned that Jesus was under Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to 
Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time.
	--Luke 23:7
%
When Herod saw Jesus, he was greatly pleased, because for a long time he had 
been wanting to see him. From what he had heard about him, he hoped to see him 
perform a sign of some sort.
	--Luke 23:8
%
He plied him with many questions, but Jesus gave him no answer.
	--Luke 23:9
%
The chief priests and the teachers of the law were standing there, vehemently 
accusing him.
	--Luke 23:10
%
Then Herod and his soldiers ridiculed and mocked him. Dressing him in an 
elegant robe, they sent him back to Pilate.
	--Luke 23:11
%
That day Herod and Pilate became friends—before this they had been enemies.
	--Luke 23:12
%
Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers and the people,
	--Luke 23:13
%
and said to them, “You brought me this man as one who was inciting the people 
to rebellion. I have examined him in your presence and have found no basis for 
your charges against him.
	--Luke 23:14
%
Neither has Herod, for he sent him back to us; as you can see, he has done 
nothing to deserve death.
	--Luke 23:15
%
Therefore, I will punish him and then release him.”
	--Luke 23:16
%

	--Luke 23:17
%
But the whole crowd shouted, “Away with this man! Release Barabbas to us!”
	--Luke 23:18
%
(Barabbas had been thrown into prison for an insurrection in the city, and for 
murder.)
	--Luke 23:19
%
Wanting to release Jesus, Pilate appealed to them again.
	--Luke 23:20
%
But they kept shouting, “Crucify him! Crucify him!”
	--Luke 23:21
%
For the third time he spoke to them: “Why? What crime has this man committed? 
I have found in him no grounds for the death penalty. Therefore I will have him 
punished and then release him.”
	--Luke 23:22
%
But with loud shouts they insistently demanded that he be crucified, and their 
shouts prevailed.
	--Luke 23:23
%
So Pilate decided to grant their demand.
	--Luke 23:24
%
He released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and 
murder, the one they asked for, and surrendered Jesus to their will.
	--Luke 23:25
%
As the soldiers led him away, they seized Simon from Cyrene, who was on his way 
in from the country, and put the cross on him and made him carry it behind 
Jesus.
	--Luke 23:26
%
A large number of people followed him, including women who mourned and wailed 
for him.
	--Luke 23:27
%
Jesus turned and said to them, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; 
weep for yourselves and for your children.
	--Luke 23:28
%
For the time will come when you will say, ‘Blessed are the childless women, 
the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!’
	--Luke 23:29
%
Then “‘they will say to the mountains, “Fall on us!” and to the hills, 
“Cover us!”’
	--Luke 23:30
%
For if people do these things when the tree is green, what will happen when it 
is dry?”
	--Luke 23:31
%
Two other men, both criminals, were also led out with him to be executed.
	--Luke 23:32
%
When they came to the place called the Skull, they crucified him there, along 
with the criminals—one on his right, the other on his left.
	--Luke 23:33
%
Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are 
doing.” And they divided up his clothes by casting lots.
	--Luke 23:34
%
The people stood watching, and the rulers even sneered at him. They said, “He 
saved others; let him save himself if he is God’s Messiah, the Chosen One.”
	--Luke 23:35
%
The soldiers also came up and mocked him. They offered him wine vinegar
	--Luke 23:36
%
and said, “If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself.”
	--Luke 23:37
%
There was a written notice above him, which read: this is the king of the jews.
	--Luke 23:38
%
One of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him: “Aren’t you the 
Messiah? Save yourself and us!”
	--Luke 23:39
%
But the other criminal rebuked him. “Don’t you fear God,” he said, 
“since you are under the same sentence?
	--Luke 23:40
%
We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this man 
has done nothing wrong.”
	--Luke 23:41
%
Then he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.”
	--Luke 23:42
%
Jesus answered him, “Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in 
paradise.”
	--Luke 23:43
%
It was now about noon, and darkness came over the whole land until three in the 
afternoon,
	--Luke 23:44
%
for the sun stopped shining. And the curtain of the temple was torn in two.
	--Luke 23:45
%
Jesus called out with a loud voice, “Father, into your hands I commit my 
spirit.” When he had said this, he breathed his last.
	--Luke 23:46
%
The centurion, seeing what had happened, praised God and said, “Surely this 
was a righteous man.”
	--Luke 23:47
%
When all the people who had gathered to witness this sight saw what took place, 
they beat their breasts and went away.
	--Luke 23:48
%
But all those who knew him, including the women who had followed him from 
Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.
	--Luke 23:49
%
Now there was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, a good and upright 
man,
	--Luke 23:50
%
who had not consented to their decision and action. He came from the Judean 
town of Arimathea, and he himself was waiting for the kingdom of God.
	--Luke 23:51
%
Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus’ body.
	--Luke 23:52
%
Then he took it down, wrapped it in linen cloth and placed it in a tomb cut in 
the rock, one in which no one had yet been laid.
	--Luke 23:53
%
It was Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was about to begin.
	--Luke 23:54
%
The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed Joseph and saw the tomb 
and how his body was laid in it.
	--Luke 23:55
%
Then they went home and prepared spices and perfumes. But they rested on the 
Sabbath in obedience to the commandment.
	--Luke 23:56
%
On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women took the 
spices they had prepared and went to the tomb.
	--Luke 24:1
%
They found the stone rolled away from the tomb,
	--Luke 24:2
%
but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
	--Luke 24:3
%
While they were wondering about this, suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed 
like lightning stood beside them.
	--Luke 24:4
%
In their fright the women bowed down with their faces to the ground, but the 
men said to them, “Why do you look for the living among the dead?
	--Luke 24:5
%
He is not here; he has risen! Remember how he told you, while he was still with 
you in Galilee:
	--Luke 24:6
%
‘The Son of Man must be delivered over to the hands of sinners, be crucified 
and on the third day be raised again.’ ”
	--Luke 24:7
%
Then they remembered his words.
	--Luke 24:8
%
When they came back from the tomb, they told all these things to the Eleven and 
to all the others.
	--Luke 24:9
%
It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the others with 
them who told this to the apostles.
	--Luke 24:10
%
But they did not believe the women, because their words seemed to them like 
nonsense.
	--Luke 24:11
%
Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. Bending over, he saw the strips of 
linen lying by themselves, and he went away, wondering to himself what had 
happened.
	--Luke 24:12
%
Now that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about 
seven miles from Jerusalem.
	--Luke 24:13
%
They were talking with each other about everything that had happened.
	--Luke 24:14
%
As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came 
up and walked along with them;
	--Luke 24:15
%
but they were kept from recognizing him.
	--Luke 24:16
%
He asked them, “What are you discussing together as you walk along?” They 
stood still, their faces downcast.
	--Luke 24:17
%
One of them, named Cleopas, asked him, “Are you the only one visiting 
Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these 
days?”
	--Luke 24:18
%
“What things?” he asked. “About Jesus of Nazareth,” they replied. “He 
was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people.
	--Luke 24:19
%
The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death, and 
they crucified him;
	--Luke 24:20
%
but we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. And what 
is more, it is the third day since all this took place.
	--Luke 24:21
%
In addition, some of our women amazed us. They went to the tomb early this 
morning
	--Luke 24:22
%
but didn’t find his body. They came and told us that they had seen a vision 
of angels, who said he was alive.
	--Luke 24:23
%
Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had 
said, but they did not see Jesus.”
	--Luke 24:24
%
He said to them, “How foolish you are, and how slow to believe all that the 
prophets have spoken!
	--Luke 24:25
%
Did not the Messiah have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?”
	--Luke 24:26
%
And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was 
said in all the Scriptures concerning himself.
	--Luke 24:27
%
As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus continued on as 
if he were going farther.
	--Luke 24:28
%
But they urged him strongly, “Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day 
is almost over.” So he went in to stay with them.
	--Luke 24:29
%
When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and 
began to give it to them.
	--Luke 24:30
%
Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from 
their sight.
	--Luke 24:31
%
They asked each other, “Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked 
with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?”
	--Luke 24:32
%
They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and 
those with them, assembled together
	--Luke 24:33
%
and saying, “It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon.”
	--Luke 24:34
%
Then the two told what had happened on the way, and how Jesus was recognized by 
them when he broke the bread.
	--Luke 24:35
%
While they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and 
said to them, “Peace be with you.”
	--Luke 24:36
%
They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost.
	--Luke 24:37
%
He said to them, “Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds?
	--Luke 24:38
%
Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does 
not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.”
	--Luke 24:39
%
When he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet.
	--Luke 24:40
%
And while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement, he asked 
them, “Do you have anything here to eat?”
	--Luke 24:41
%
They gave him a piece of broiled fish,
	--Luke 24:42
%
and he took it and ate it in their presence.
	--Luke 24:43
%
He said to them, “This is what I told you while I was still with you: 
Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the 
Prophets and the Psalms.”
	--Luke 24:44
%
Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures.
	--Luke 24:45
%
He told them, “This is what is written: The Messiah will suffer and rise from 
the dead on the third day,
	--Luke 24:46
%
and repentance for the forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all 
nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
	--Luke 24:47
%
You are witnesses of these things.
	--Luke 24:48
%
I am going to send you what my Father has promised; but stay in the city until 
you have been clothed with power from on high.”
	--Luke 24:49
%
When he had led them out to the vicinity of Bethany, he lifted up his hands and 
blessed them.
	--Luke 24:50
%
While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up into heaven.
	--Luke 24:51
%
Then they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.
	--Luke 24:52
%
And they stayed continually at the temple, praising God.
	--Luke 24:53
%
The beginning of the good news about Jesus the Messiah, the Son of God,
	--Mark 1:1
%
as it is written in Isaiah the prophet: “I will send my messenger ahead of 
you, who will prepare your way”—
	--Mark 1:2
%
“a voice of one calling in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way for the Lord, 
make straight paths for him.’”
	--Mark 1:3
%
And so John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of 
repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
	--Mark 1:4
%
The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. 
Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.
	--Mark 1:5
%
John wore clothing made of camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his 
waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.
	--Mark 1:6
%
And this was his message: “After me comes the one more powerful than I, the 
straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.
	--Mark 1:7
%
I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”
	--Mark 1:8
%
At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in 
the Jordan.
	--Mark 1:9
%
Just as Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and 
the Spirit descending on him like a dove.
	--Mark 1:10
%
And a voice came from heaven: “You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am 
well pleased.”
	--Mark 1:11
%
At once the Spirit sent him out into the wilderness,
	--Mark 1:12
%
and he was in the wilderness forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with 
the wild animals, and angels attended him.
	--Mark 1:13
%
After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good 
news of God.
	--Mark 1:14
%
“The time has come,” he said. “The kingdom of God has come near. Repent 
and believe the good news!”
	--Mark 1:15
%
As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew 
casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
	--Mark 1:16
%
“Come, follow me,” Jesus said, “and I will send you out to fish for 
people.”
	--Mark 1:17
%
At once they left their nets and followed him.
	--Mark 1:18
%
When he had gone a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother 
John in a boat, preparing their nets.
	--Mark 1:19
%
Without delay he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat 
with the hired men and followed him.
	--Mark 1:20
%
They went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the 
synagogue and began to teach.
	--Mark 1:21
%
The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had 
authority, not as the teachers of the law.
	--Mark 1:22
%
Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an impure spirit cried 
out,
	--Mark 1:23
%
“What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I 
know who you are—the Holy One of God!”
	--Mark 1:24
%
“Be quiet!” said Jesus sternly. “Come out of him!”
	--Mark 1:25
%
The impure spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek.
	--Mark 1:26
%
The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, “What is this? A 
new teaching—and with authority! He even gives orders to impure spirits and 
they obey him.”
	--Mark 1:27
%
News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee.
	--Mark 1:28
%
As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home 
of Simon and Andrew.
	--Mark 1:29
%
Simon’s mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they immediately told 
Jesus about her.
	--Mark 1:30
%
So he went to her, took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her and she 
began to wait on them.
	--Mark 1:31
%
That evening after sunset the people brought to Jesus all the sick and 
demon-possessed.
	--Mark 1:32
%
The whole town gathered at the door,
	--Mark 1:33
%
and Jesus healed many who had various diseases. He also drove out many demons, 
but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was.
	--Mark 1:34
%
Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the 
house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed.
	--Mark 1:35
%
Simon and his companions went to look for him,
	--Mark 1:36
%
and when they found him, they exclaimed: “Everyone is looking for you!”
	--Mark 1:37
%
Jesus replied, “Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby villages—so I can 
preach there also. That is why I have come.”
	--Mark 1:38
%
So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving 
out demons.
	--Mark 1:39
%
A man with leprosy came to him and begged him on his knees, “If you are 
willing, you can make me clean.”
	--Mark 1:40
%
Jesus was indignant. He reached out his hand and touched the man. “I am 
willing,” he said. “Be clean!”
	--Mark 1:41
%
Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cleansed.
	--Mark 1:42
%
Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning:
	--Mark 1:43
%
“See that you don’t tell this to anyone. But go, show yourself to the 
priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a 
testimony to them.”
	--Mark 1:44
%
Instead he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news. As a result, 
Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places. 
Yet the people still came to him from everywhere.
	--Mark 1:45
%
A few days later, when Jesus again entered Capernaum, the people heard that he 
had come home.
	--Mark 2:1
%
They gathered in such large numbers that there was no room left, not even 
outside the door, and he preached the word to them.
	--Mark 2:2
%
Some men came, bringing to him a paralyzed man, carried by four of them.
	--Mark 2:3
%
Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an 
opening in the roof above Jesus by digging through it and then lowered the mat 
the man was lying on.
	--Mark 2:4
%
When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, “Son, your sins are 
forgiven.”
	--Mark 2:5
%
Now some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to themselves,
	--Mark 2:6
%
“Why does this fellow talk like that? He’s blaspheming! Who can forgive 
sins but God alone?”
	--Mark 2:7
%
Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in 
their hearts, and he said to them, “Why are you thinking these things?
	--Mark 2:8
%
Which is easier: to say to this paralyzed man, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or 
to say, ‘Get up, take your mat and walk’?
	--Mark 2:9
%
But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive 
sins.” So he said to the man,
	--Mark 2:10
%
“I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home.”
	--Mark 2:11
%
He got up, took his mat and walked out in full view of them all. This amazed 
everyone and they praised God, saying, “We have never seen anything like 
this!”
	--Mark 2:12
%
Once again Jesus went out beside the lake. A large crowd came to him, and he 
began to teach them.
	--Mark 2:13
%
As he walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax 
collector’s booth. “Follow me,” Jesus told him, and Levi got up and 
followed him.
	--Mark 2:14
%
While Jesus was having dinner at Levi’s house, many tax collectors and 
sinners were eating with him and his disciples, for there were many who 
followed him.
	--Mark 2:15
%
When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw him eating with the sinners 
and tax collectors, they asked his disciples: “Why does he eat with tax 
collectors and sinners?”
	--Mark 2:16
%
On hearing this, Jesus said to them, “It is not the healthy who need a 
doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”
	--Mark 2:17
%
Now John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. Some people came and 
asked Jesus, “How is it that John’s disciples and the disciples of the 
Pharisees are fasting, but yours are not?”
	--Mark 2:18
%
Jesus answered, “How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with 
them? They cannot, so long as they have him with them.
	--Mark 2:19
%
But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and on that 
day they will fast.
	--Mark 2:20
%
“No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. Otherwise, the new 
piece will pull away from the old, making the tear worse.
	--Mark 2:21
%
And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the wine will burst 
the skins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour 
new wine into new wineskins.”
	--Mark 2:22
%
One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and as his disciples 
walked along, they began to pick some heads of grain.
	--Mark 2:23
%
The Pharisees said to him, “Look, why are they doing what is unlawful on the 
Sabbath?”
	--Mark 2:24
%
He answered, “Have you never read what David did when he and his companions 
were hungry and in need?
	--Mark 2:25
%
In the days of Abiathar the high priest, he entered the house of God and ate 
the consecrated bread, which is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also 
gave some to his companions.”
	--Mark 2:26
%
Then he said to them, “The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.
	--Mark 2:27
%
So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.”
	--Mark 2:28
%
Another time Jesus went into the synagogue, and a man with a shriveled hand was 
there.
	--Mark 3:1
%
Some of them were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him 
closely to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath.
	--Mark 3:2
%
Jesus said to the man with the shriveled hand, “Stand up in front of 
everyone.”
	--Mark 3:3
%
Then Jesus asked them, “Which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do 
evil, to save life or to kill?” But they remained silent.
	--Mark 3:4
%
He looked around at them in anger and, deeply distressed at their stubborn 
hearts, said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He stretched it out, and 
his hand was completely restored.
	--Mark 3:5
%
Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians how they might 
kill Jesus.
	--Mark 3:6
%
Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lake, and a large crowd from Galilee 
followed.
	--Mark 3:7
%
When they heard about all he was doing, many people came to him from Judea, 
Jerusalem, Idumea, and the regions across the Jordan and around Tyre and Sidon.
	--Mark 3:8
%
Because of the crowd he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him, 
to keep the people from crowding him.
	--Mark 3:9
%
For he had healed many, so that those with diseases were pushing forward to 
touch him.
	--Mark 3:10
%
Whenever the impure spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, 
“You are the Son of God.”
	--Mark 3:11
%
But he gave them strict orders not to tell others about him.
	--Mark 3:12
%
Jesus went up on a mountainside and called to him those he wanted, and they 
came to him.
	--Mark 3:13
%
He appointed twelve that they might be with him and that he might send them out 
to preach
	--Mark 3:14
%
and to have authority to drive out demons.
	--Mark 3:15
%
These are the twelve he appointed: Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter),
	--Mark 3:16
%
James son of Zebedee and his brother John (to them he gave the name Boanerges, 
which means “sons of thunder”),
	--Mark 3:17
%
Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, 
Simon the Zealot
	--Mark 3:18
%
and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.
	--Mark 3:19
%
Then Jesus entered a house, and again a crowd gathered, so that he and his 
disciples were not even able to eat.
	--Mark 3:20
%
When his family heard about this, they went to take charge of him, for they 
said, “He is out of his mind.”
	--Mark 3:21
%
And the teachers of the law who came down from Jerusalem said, “He is 
possessed by Beelzebul! By the prince of demons he is driving out demons.”
	--Mark 3:22
%
So Jesus called them over to him and began to speak to them in parables: “How 
can Satan drive out Satan?
	--Mark 3:23
%
If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
	--Mark 3:24
%
If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.
	--Mark 3:25
%
And if Satan opposes himself and is divided, he cannot stand; his end has come.
	--Mark 3:26
%
In fact, no one can enter a strong man’s house without first tying him up. 
Then he can plunder the strong man’s house.
	--Mark 3:27
%
Truly I tell you, people can be forgiven all their sins and every slander they 
utter,
	--Mark 3:28
%
but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; they are 
guilty of an eternal sin.”
	--Mark 3:29
%
He said this because they were saying, “He has an impure spirit.”
	--Mark 3:30
%
Then Jesus’ mother and brothers arrived. Standing outside, they sent someone 
in to call him.
	--Mark 3:31
%
A crowd was sitting around him, and they told him, “Your mother and brothers 
are outside looking for you.”
	--Mark 3:32
%
“Who are my mother and my brothers?” he asked.
	--Mark 3:33
%
Then he looked at those seated in a circle around him and said, “Here are my 
mother and my brothers!
	--Mark 3:34
%
Whoever does God’s will is my brother and sister and mother.”
	--Mark 3:35
%
Again Jesus began to teach by the lake. The crowd that gathered around him was 
so large that he got into a boat and sat in it out on the lake, while all the 
people were along the shore at the water’s edge.
	--Mark 4:1
%
He taught them many things by parables, and in his teaching said:
	--Mark 4:2
%
“Listen! A farmer went out to sow his seed.
	--Mark 4:3
%
As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and 
ate it up.
	--Mark 4:4
%
Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up 
quickly, because the soil was shallow.
	--Mark 4:5
%
But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because 
they had no root.
	--Mark 4:6
%
Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants, so that they 
did not bear grain.
	--Mark 4:7
%
Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up, grew and produced a crop, some 
multiplying thirty, some sixty, some a hundred times.”
	--Mark 4:8
%
Then Jesus said, “Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear.”
	--Mark 4:9
%
When he was alone, the Twelve and the others around him asked him about the 
parables.
	--Mark 4:10
%
He told them, “The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to 
those on the outside everything is said in parables
	--Mark 4:11
%
so that, “‘they may be ever seeing but never perceiving, and ever hearing 
but never understanding; otherwise they might turn and be forgiven!’”
	--Mark 4:12
%
Then Jesus said to them, “Don’t you understand this parable? How then will 
you understand any parable?
	--Mark 4:13
%
The farmer sows the word.
	--Mark 4:14
%
Some people are like seed along the path, where the word is sown. As soon as 
they hear it, Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them.
	--Mark 4:15
%
Others, like seed sown on rocky places, hear the word and at once receive it 
with joy.
	--Mark 4:16
%
But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or 
persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.
	--Mark 4:17
%
Still others, like seed sown among thorns, hear the word;
	--Mark 4:18
%
but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for 
other things come in and choke the word, making it unfruitful.
	--Mark 4:19
%
Others, like seed sown on good soil, hear the word, accept it, and produce a 
crop—some thirty, some sixty, some a hundred times what was sown.”
	--Mark 4:20
%
He said to them, “Do you bring in a lamp to put it under a bowl or a bed? 
Instead, don’t you put it on its stand?
	--Mark 4:21
%
For whatever is hidden is meant to be disclosed, and whatever is concealed is 
meant to be brought out into the open.
	--Mark 4:22
%
If anyone has ears to hear, let them hear.”
	--Mark 4:23
%
“Consider carefully what you hear,” he continued. “With the measure you 
use, it will be measured to you—and even more.
	--Mark 4:24
%
Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what they have will 
be taken from them.”
	--Mark 4:25
%
He also said, “This is what the kingdom of God is like. A man scatters seed 
on the ground.
	--Mark 4:26
%
Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and grows, though 
he does not know how.
	--Mark 4:27
%
All by itself the soil produces grain—first the stalk, then the head, then 
the full kernel in the head.
	--Mark 4:28
%
As soon as the grain is ripe, he puts the sickle to it, because the harvest has 
come.”
	--Mark 4:29
%
Again he said, “What shall we say the kingdom of God is like, or what parable 
shall we use to describe it?
	--Mark 4:30
%
It is like a mustard seed, which is the smallest of all seeds on earth.
	--Mark 4:31
%
Yet when planted, it grows and becomes the largest of all garden plants, with 
such big branches that the birds can perch in its shade.”
	--Mark 4:32
%
With many similar parables Jesus spoke the word to them, as much as they could 
understand.
	--Mark 4:33
%
He did not say anything to them without using a parable. But when he was alone 
with his own disciples, he explained everything.
	--Mark 4:34
%
That day when evening came, he said to his disciples, “Let us go over to the 
other side.”
	--Mark 4:35
%
Leaving the crowd behind, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat. 
There were also other boats with him.
	--Mark 4:36
%
A furious squall came up, and the waves broke over the boat, so that it was 
nearly swamped.
	--Mark 4:37
%
Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion. The disciples woke him and said 
to him, “Teacher, don’t you care if we drown?”
	--Mark 4:38
%
He got up, rebuked the wind and said to the waves, “Quiet! Be still!” Then 
the wind died down and it was completely calm.
	--Mark 4:39
%
He said to his disciples, “Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no 
faith?”
	--Mark 4:40
%
They were terrified and asked each other, “Who is this? Even the wind and the 
waves obey him!”
	--Mark 4:41
%
They went across the lake to the region of the Gerasenes.
	--Mark 5:1
%
When Jesus got out of the boat, a man with an impure spirit came from the tombs 
to meet him.
	--Mark 5:2
%
This man lived in the tombs, and no one could bind him anymore, not even with a 
chain.
	--Mark 5:3
%
For he had often been chained hand and foot, but he tore the chains apart and 
broke the irons on his feet. No one was strong enough to subdue him.
	--Mark 5:4
%
Night and day among the tombs and in the hills he would cry out and cut himself 
with stones.
	--Mark 5:5
%
When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees in front of him.
	--Mark 5:6
%
He shouted at the top of his voice, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of 
the Most High God? In God’s name don’t torture me!”
	--Mark 5:7
%
For Jesus had said to him, “Come out of this man, you impure spirit!”
	--Mark 5:8
%
Then Jesus asked him, “What is your name?” “My name is Legion,” he 
replied, “for we are many.”
	--Mark 5:9
%
And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area.
	--Mark 5:10
%
A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside.
	--Mark 5:11
%
The demons begged Jesus, “Send us among the pigs; allow us to go into them.”
	--Mark 5:12
%
He gave them permission, and the impure spirits came out and went into the 
pigs. The herd, about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into 
the lake and were drowned.
	--Mark 5:13
%
Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, 
and the people went out to see what had happened.
	--Mark 5:14
%
When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion 
of demons, sitting there, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.
	--Mark 5:15
%
Those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demon-possessed 
man—and told about the pigs as well.
	--Mark 5:16
%
Then the people began to plead with Jesus to leave their region.
	--Mark 5:17
%
As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged 
to go with him.
	--Mark 5:18
%
Jesus did not let him, but said, “Go home to your own people and tell them 
how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you.”
	--Mark 5:19
%
So the man went away and began to tell in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done 
for him. And all the people were amazed.
	--Mark 5:20
%
When Jesus had again crossed over by boat to the other side of the lake, a 
large crowd gathered around him while he was by the lake.
	--Mark 5:21
%
Then one of the synagogue leaders, named Jairus, came, and when he saw Jesus, 
he fell at his feet.
	--Mark 5:22
%
He pleaded earnestly with him, “My little daughter is dying. Please come and 
put your hands on her so that she will be healed and live.”
	--Mark 5:23
%
So Jesus went with him. A large crowd followed and pressed around him.
	--Mark 5:24
%
And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years.
	--Mark 5:25
%
She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all 
she had, yet instead of getting better she grew worse.
	--Mark 5:26
%
When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his 
cloak,
	--Mark 5:27
%
because she thought, “If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed.”
	--Mark 5:28
%
Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed 
from her suffering.
	--Mark 5:29
%
At once Jesus realized that power had gone out from him. He turned around in 
the crowd and asked, “Who touched my clothes?”
	--Mark 5:30
%
“You see the people crowding against you,” his disciples answered, “and 
yet you can ask, ‘Who touched me?’ ”
	--Mark 5:31
%
But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it.
	--Mark 5:32
%
Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet 
and, trembling with fear, told him the whole truth.
	--Mark 5:33
%
He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be 
freed from your suffering.”
	--Mark 5:34
%
While Jesus was still speaking, some people came from the house of Jairus, the 
synagogue leader. “Your daughter is dead,” they said. “Why bother the 
teacher anymore?”
	--Mark 5:35
%
Overhearing what they said, Jesus told him, “Don’t be afraid; just 
believe.”
	--Mark 5:36
%
He did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James and John the brother of 
James.
	--Mark 5:37
%
When they came to the home of the synagogue leader, Jesus saw a commotion, with 
people crying and wailing loudly.
	--Mark 5:38
%
He went in and said to them, “Why all this commotion and wailing? The child 
is not dead but asleep.”
	--Mark 5:39
%
But they laughed at him. After he put them all out, he took the child’s 
father and mother and the disciples who were with him, and went in where the 
child was.
	--Mark 5:40
%
He took her by the hand and said to her, “Talitha koum!” (which means 
“Little girl, I say to you, get up!”).
	--Mark 5:41
%
Immediately the girl stood up and began to walk around (she was twelve years 
old). At this they were completely astonished.
	--Mark 5:42
%
He gave strict orders not to let anyone know about this, and told them to give 
her something to eat.
	--Mark 5:43
%
Jesus left there and went to his hometown, accompanied by his disciples.
	--Mark 6:1
%
When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard 
him were amazed. “Where did this man get these things?” they asked. 
“What’s this wisdom that has been given him? What are these remarkable 
miracles he is performing?
	--Mark 6:2
%
Isn’t this the carpenter? Isn’t this Mary’s son and the brother of James, 
Joseph, Judas and Simon? Aren’t his sisters here with us?” And they took 
offense at him.
	--Mark 6:3
%
Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, 
among his relatives and in his own home.”
	--Mark 6:4
%
He could not do any miracles there, except lay his hands on a few sick people 
and heal them.
	--Mark 6:5
%
He was amazed at their lack of faith. Then Jesus went around teaching from 
village to village.
	--Mark 6:6
%
Calling the Twelve to him, he began to send them out two by two and gave them 
authority over impure spirits.
	--Mark 6:7
%
These were his instructions: “Take nothing for the journey except a 
staff—no bread, no bag, no money in your belts.
	--Mark 6:8
%
Wear sandals but not an extra shirt.
	--Mark 6:9
%
Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you leave that town.
	--Mark 6:10
%
And if any place will not welcome you or listen to you, leave that place and 
shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them.”
	--Mark 6:11
%
They went out and preached that people should repent.
	--Mark 6:12
%
They drove out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed 
them.
	--Mark 6:13
%
King Herod heard about this, for Jesus’ name had become well known. Some were 
saying, “John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why 
miraculous powers are at work in him.”
	--Mark 6:14
%
Others said, “He is Elijah.” And still others claimed, “He is a prophet, 
like one of the prophets of long ago.”
	--Mark 6:15
%
But when Herod heard this, he said, “John, whom I beheaded, has been raised 
from the dead!”
	--Mark 6:16
%
For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and he had him bound 
and put in prison. He did this because of Herodias, his brother Philip’s 
wife, whom he had married.
	--Mark 6:17
%
For John had been saying to Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your 
brother’s wife.”
	--Mark 6:18
%
So Herodias nursed a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she was 
not able to,
	--Mark 6:19
%
because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing him to be a righteous and 
holy man. When Herod heard John, he was greatly puzzled; yet he liked to listen 
to him.
	--Mark 6:20
%
Finally the opportune time came. On his birthday Herod gave a banquet for his 
high officials and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee.
	--Mark 6:21
%
When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his 
dinner guests. The king said to the girl, “Ask me for anything you want, and 
I’ll give it to you.”
	--Mark 6:22
%
And he promised her with an oath, “Whatever you ask I will give you, up to 
half my kingdom.”
	--Mark 6:23
%
She went out and said to her mother, “What shall I ask for?” “The head of 
John the Baptist,” she answered.
	--Mark 6:24
%
At once the girl hurried in to the king with the request: “I want you to give 
me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter.”
	--Mark 6:25
%
The king was greatly distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner 
guests, he did not want to refuse her.
	--Mark 6:26
%
So he immediately sent an executioner with orders to bring John’s head. The 
man went, beheaded John in the prison,
	--Mark 6:27
%
and brought back his head on a platter. He presented it to the girl, and she 
gave it to her mother.
	--Mark 6:28
%
On hearing of this, John’s disciples came and took his body and laid it in a 
tomb.
	--Mark 6:29
%
The apostles gathered around Jesus and reported to him all they had done and 
taught.
	--Mark 6:30
%
Then, because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have 
a chance to eat, he said to them, “Come with me by yourselves to a quiet 
place and get some rest.”
	--Mark 6:31
%
So they went away by themselves in a boat to a solitary place.
	--Mark 6:32
%
But many who saw them leaving recognized them and ran on foot from all the 
towns and got there ahead of them.
	--Mark 6:33
%
When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them, because 
they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began teaching them many things.
	--Mark 6:34
%
By this time it was late in the day, so his disciples came to him. “This is a 
remote place,” they said, “and it’s already very late.
	--Mark 6:35
%
Send the people away so that they can go to the surrounding countryside and 
villages and buy themselves something to eat.”
	--Mark 6:36
%
But he answered, “You give them something to eat.” They said to him, 
“That would take more than half a year’s wages! Are we to go and spend that 
much on bread and give it to them to eat?”
	--Mark 6:37
%
“How many loaves do you have?” he asked. “Go and see.” When they found 
out, they said, “Five—and two fish.”
	--Mark 6:38
%
Then Jesus directed them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green 
grass.
	--Mark 6:39
%
So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties.
	--Mark 6:40
%
Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave 
thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to his disciples to distribute 
to the people. He also divided the two fish among them all.
	--Mark 6:41
%
They all ate and were satisfied,
	--Mark 6:42
%
and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and 
fish.
	--Mark 6:43
%
The number of the men who had eaten was five thousand.
	--Mark 6:44
%
Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him 
to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd.
	--Mark 6:45
%
After leaving them, he went up on a mountainside to pray.
	--Mark 6:46
%
Later that night, the boat was in the middle of the lake, and he was alone on 
land.
	--Mark 6:47
%
He saw the disciples straining at the oars, because the wind was against them. 
Shortly before dawn he went out to them, walking on the lake. He was about to 
pass by them,
	--Mark 6:48
%
but when they saw him walking on the lake, they thought he was a ghost. They 
cried out,
	--Mark 6:49
%
because they all saw him and were terrified. Immediately he spoke to them and 
said, “Take courage! It is I. Don’t be afraid.”
	--Mark 6:50
%
Then he climbed into the boat with them, and the wind died down. They were 
completely amazed,
	--Mark 6:51
%
for they had not understood about the loaves; their hearts were hardened.
	--Mark 6:52
%
When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret and anchored there.
	--Mark 6:53
%
As soon as they got out of the boat, people recognized Jesus.
	--Mark 6:54
%
They ran throughout that whole region and carried the sick on mats to wherever 
they heard he was.
	--Mark 6:55
%
And wherever he went—into villages, towns or countryside—they placed the 
sick in the marketplaces. They begged him to let them touch even the edge of 
his cloak, and all who touched it were healed.
	--Mark 6:56
%
The Pharisees and some of the teachers of the law who had come from Jerusalem 
gathered around Jesus
	--Mark 7:1
%
and saw some of his disciples eating food with hands that were defiled, that 
is, unwashed.
	--Mark 7:2
%
(The Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they give their hands a 
ceremonial washing, holding to the tradition of the elders.
	--Mark 7:3
%
When they come from the marketplace they do not eat unless they wash. And they 
observe many other traditions, such as the washing of cups, pitchers and 
kettles.)
	--Mark 7:4
%
So the Pharisees and teachers of the law asked Jesus, “Why don’t your 
disciples live according to the tradition of the elders instead of eating their 
food with defiled hands?”
	--Mark 7:5
%
He replied, “Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it 
is written: “‘These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are 
far from me.
	--Mark 7:6
%
They worship me in vain; their teachings are merely human rules.’
	--Mark 7:7
%
You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to human 
traditions.”
	--Mark 7:8
%
And he continued, “You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God 
in order to observe your own traditions!
	--Mark 7:9
%
For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and mother,’ and, ‘Anyone who curses 
their father or mother is to be put to death.’
	--Mark 7:10
%
But you say that if anyone declares that what might have been used to help 
their father or mother is Corban (that is, devoted to God)—
	--Mark 7:11
%
then you no longer let them do anything for their father or mother.
	--Mark 7:12
%
Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. 
And you do many things like that.”
	--Mark 7:13
%
Again Jesus called the crowd to him and said, “Listen to me, everyone, and 
understand this.
	--Mark 7:14
%
Nothing outside a person can defile them by going into them. Rather, it is what 
comes out of a person that defiles them.”
	--Mark 7:15
%

	--Mark 7:16
%
After he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him 
about this parable.
	--Mark 7:17
%
“Are you so dull?” he asked. “Don’t you see that nothing that enters a 
person from the outside can defile them?
	--Mark 7:18
%
For it doesn’t go into their heart but into their stomach, and then out of 
the body.” (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods clean.)
	--Mark 7:19
%
He went on: “What comes out of a person is what defiles them.
	--Mark 7:20
%
For it is from within, out of a person’s heart, that evil thoughts 
come—sexual immorality, theft, murder,
	--Mark 7:21
%
adultery, greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly.
	--Mark 7:22
%
All these evils come from inside and defile a person.”
	--Mark 7:23
%
Jesus left that place and went to the vicinity of Tyre. He entered a house and 
did not want anyone to know it; yet he could not keep his presence secret.
	--Mark 7:24
%
In fact, as soon as she heard about him, a woman whose little daughter was 
possessed by an impure spirit came and fell at his feet.
	--Mark 7:25
%
The woman was a Greek, born in Syrian Phoenicia. She begged Jesus to drive the 
demon out of her daughter.
	--Mark 7:26
%
“First let the children eat all they want,” he told her, “for it is not 
right to take the children’s bread and toss it to the dogs.”
	--Mark 7:27
%
“Lord,” she replied, “even the dogs under the table eat the children’s 
crumbs.”
	--Mark 7:28
%
Then he told her, “For such a reply, you may go; the demon has left your 
daughter.”
	--Mark 7:29
%
She went home and found her child lying on the bed, and the demon gone.
	--Mark 7:30
%
Then Jesus left the vicinity of Tyre and went through Sidon, down to the Sea of 
Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis.
	--Mark 7:31
%
There some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk, and 
they begged Jesus to place his hand on him.
	--Mark 7:32
%
After he took him aside, away from the crowd, Jesus put his fingers into the 
man’s ears. Then he spit and touched the man’s tongue.
	--Mark 7:33
%
He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him, “Ephphatha!” 
(which means “Be opened!”).
	--Mark 7:34
%
At this, the man’s ears were opened, his tongue was loosened and he began to 
speak plainly.
	--Mark 7:35
%
Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone. But the more he did so, the more they 
kept talking about it.
	--Mark 7:36
%
People were overwhelmed with amazement. “He has done everything well,” they 
said. “He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.”
	--Mark 7:37
%
During those days another large crowd gathered. Since they had nothing to eat, 
Jesus called his disciples to him and said,
	--Mark 8:1
%
“I have compassion for these people; they have already been with me three 
days and have nothing to eat.
	--Mark 8:2
%
If I send them home hungry, they will collapse on the way, because some of them 
have come a long distance.”
	--Mark 8:3
%
His disciples answered, “But where in this remote place can anyone get enough 
bread to feed them?”
	--Mark 8:4
%
“How many loaves do you have?” Jesus asked. “Seven,” they replied.
	--Mark 8:5
%
He told the crowd to sit down on the ground. When he had taken the seven loaves 
and given thanks, he broke them and gave them to his disciples to distribute to 
the people, and they did so.
	--Mark 8:6
%
They had a few small fish as well; he gave thanks for them also and told the 
disciples to distribute them.
	--Mark 8:7
%
The people ate and were satisfied. Afterward the disciples picked up seven 
basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.
	--Mark 8:8
%
About four thousand were present. After he had sent them away,
	--Mark 8:9
%
he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the region of Dalmanutha.
	--Mark 8:10
%
The Pharisees came and began to question Jesus. To test him, they asked him for 
a sign from heaven.
	--Mark 8:11
%
He sighed deeply and said, “Why does this generation ask for a sign? Truly I 
tell you, no sign will be given to it.”
	--Mark 8:12
%
Then he left them, got back into the boat and crossed to the other side.
	--Mark 8:13
%
The disciples had forgotten to bring bread, except for one loaf they had with 
them in the boat.
	--Mark 8:14
%
“Be careful,” Jesus warned them. “Watch out for the yeast of the 
Pharisees and that of Herod.”
	--Mark 8:15
%
They discussed this with one another and said, “It is because we have no 
bread.”
	--Mark 8:16
%
Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked them: “Why are you talking about 
having no bread? Do you still not see or understand? Are your hearts hardened?
	--Mark 8:17
%
Do you have eyes but fail to see, and ears but fail to hear? And don’t you 
remember?
	--Mark 8:18
%
When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many basketfuls of 
pieces did you pick up?” “Twelve,” they replied.
	--Mark 8:19
%
“And when I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many basketfuls 
of pieces did you pick up?” They answered, “Seven.”
	--Mark 8:20
%
He said to them, “Do you still not understand?”
	--Mark 8:21
%
They came to Bethsaida, and some people brought a blind man and begged Jesus to 
touch him.
	--Mark 8:22
%
He took the blind man by the hand and led him outside the village. When he had 
spit on the man’s eyes and put his hands on him, Jesus asked, “Do you see 
anything?”
	--Mark 8:23
%
He looked up and said, “I see people; they look like trees walking around.”
	--Mark 8:24
%
Once more Jesus put his hands on the man’s eyes. Then his eyes were opened, 
his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly.
	--Mark 8:25
%
Jesus sent him home, saying, “Don’t even go into the village.”
	--Mark 8:26
%
Jesus and his disciples went on to the villages around Caesarea Philippi. On 
the way he asked them, “Who do people say I am?”
	--Mark 8:27
%
They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still 
others, one of the prophets.”
	--Mark 8:28
%
“But what about you?” he asked. “Who do you say I am?” Peter answered, 
“You are the Messiah.”
	--Mark 8:29
%
Jesus warned them not to tell anyone about him.
	--Mark 8:30
%
He then began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be 
rejected by the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and that 
he must be killed and after three days rise again.
	--Mark 8:31
%
He spoke plainly about this, and Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.
	--Mark 8:32
%
But when Jesus turned and looked at his disciples, he rebuked Peter. “Get 
behind me, Satan!” he said. “You do not have in mind the concerns of God, 
but merely human concerns.”
	--Mark 8:33
%
Then he called the crowd to him along with his disciples and said: “Whoever 
wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow 
me.
	--Mark 8:34
%
For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life 
for me and for the gospel will save it.
	--Mark 8:35
%
What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul?
	--Mark 8:36
%
Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?
	--Mark 8:37
%
If anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful 
generation, the Son of Man will be ashamed of them when he comes in his 
Father’s glory with the holy angels.”
	--Mark 8:38
%
And he said to them, “Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not 
taste death before they see that the kingdom of God has come with power.”
	--Mark 9:1
%
After six days Jesus took Peter, James and John with him and led them up a high 
mountain, where they were all alone. There he was transfigured before them.
	--Mark 9:2
%
His clothes became dazzling white, whiter than anyone in the world could bleach 
them.
	--Mark 9:3
%
And there appeared before them Elijah and Moses, who were talking with Jesus.
	--Mark 9:4
%
Peter said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up 
three shelters—one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.”
	--Mark 9:5
%
(He did not know what to say, they were so frightened.)
	--Mark 9:6
%
Then a cloud appeared and covered them, and a voice came from the cloud: 
“This is my Son, whom I love. Listen to him!”
	--Mark 9:7
%
Suddenly, when they looked around, they no longer saw anyone with them except 
Jesus.
	--Mark 9:8
%
As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus gave them orders not to tell 
anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.
	--Mark 9:9
%
They kept the matter to themselves, discussing what “rising from the dead” 
meant.
	--Mark 9:10
%
And they asked him, “Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come 
first?”
	--Mark 9:11
%
Jesus replied, “To be sure, Elijah does come first, and restores all things. 
Why then is it written that the Son of Man must suffer much and be rejected?
	--Mark 9:12
%
But I tell you, Elijah has come, and they have done to him everything they 
wished, just as it is written about him.”
	--Mark 9:13
%
When they came to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and 
the teachers of the law arguing with them.
	--Mark 9:14
%
As soon as all the people saw Jesus, they were overwhelmed with wonder and ran 
to greet him.
	--Mark 9:15
%
“What are you arguing with them about?” he asked.
	--Mark 9:16
%
A man in the crowd answered, “Teacher, I brought you my son, who is possessed 
by a spirit that has robbed him of speech.
	--Mark 9:17
%
Whenever it seizes him, it throws him to the ground. He foams at the mouth, 
gnashes his teeth and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to drive out the 
spirit, but they could not.”
	--Mark 9:18
%
“You unbelieving generation,” Jesus replied, “how long shall I stay with 
you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring the boy to me.”
	--Mark 9:19
%
So they brought him. When the spirit saw Jesus, it immediately threw the boy 
into a convulsion. He fell to the ground and rolled around, foaming at the 
mouth.
	--Mark 9:20
%
Jesus asked the boy’s father, “How long has he been like this?” “From 
childhood,” he answered.
	--Mark 9:21
%
“It has often thrown him into fire or water to kill him. But if you can do 
anything, take pity on us and help us.”
	--Mark 9:22
%
“‘If you can’?” said Jesus. “Everything is possible for one who 
believes.”
	--Mark 9:23
%
Immediately the boy’s father exclaimed, “I do believe; help me overcome my 
unbelief!”
	--Mark 9:24
%
When Jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene, he rebuked the impure 
spirit. “You deaf and mute spirit,” he said, “I command you, come out of 
him and never enter him again.”
	--Mark 9:25
%
The spirit shrieked, convulsed him violently and came out. The boy looked so 
much like a corpse that many said, “He’s dead.”
	--Mark 9:26
%
But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him to his feet, and he stood up.
	--Mark 9:27
%
After Jesus had gone indoors, his disciples asked him privately, “Why 
couldn’t we drive it out?”
	--Mark 9:28
%
He replied, “This kind can come out only by prayer.”
	--Mark 9:29
%
They left that place and passed through Galilee. Jesus did not want anyone to 
know where they were,
	--Mark 9:30
%
because he was teaching his disciples. He said to them, “The Son of Man is 
going to be delivered into the hands of men. They will kill him, and after 
three days he will rise.”
	--Mark 9:31
%
But they did not understand what he meant and were afraid to ask him about it.
	--Mark 9:32
%
They came to Capernaum. When he was in the house, he asked them, “What were 
you arguing about on the road?”
	--Mark 9:33
%
But they kept quiet because on the way they had argued about who was the 
greatest.
	--Mark 9:34
%
Sitting down, Jesus called the Twelve and said, “Anyone who wants to be first 
must be the very last, and the servant of all.”
	--Mark 9:35
%
He took a little child whom he placed among them. Taking the child in his arms, 
he said to them,
	--Mark 9:36
%
“Whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me; and 
whoever welcomes me does not welcome me but the one who sent me.”
	--Mark 9:37
%
“Teacher,” said John, “we saw someone driving out demons in your name and 
we told him to stop, because he was not one of us.”
	--Mark 9:38
%
“Do not stop him,” Jesus said. “For no one who does a miracle in my name 
can in the next moment say anything bad about me,
	--Mark 9:39
%
for whoever is not against us is for us.
	--Mark 9:40
%
Truly I tell you, anyone who gives you a cup of water in my name because you 
belong to the Messiah will certainly not lose their reward.
	--Mark 9:41
%
“If anyone causes one of these little ones—those who believe in me—to 
stumble, it would be better for them if a large millstone were hung around 
their neck and they were thrown into the sea.
	--Mark 9:42
%
If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter 
life maimed than with two hands to go into hell, where the fire never goes out.
	--Mark 9:43
%

	--Mark 9:44
%
And if your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to 
enter life crippled than to have two feet and be thrown into hell.
	--Mark 9:45
%

	--Mark 9:46
%
And if your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out. It is better for you to 
enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into 
hell,
	--Mark 9:47
%
where “‘the worms that eat them do not die, and the fire is not quenched.’
	--Mark 9:48
%
Everyone will be salted with fire.
	--Mark 9:49
%
“Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, how can you make it salty 
again? Have salt among yourselves, and be at peace with each other.”
	--Mark 9:50
%
Jesus then left that place and went into the region of Judea and across the 
Jordan. Again crowds of people came to him, and as was his custom, he taught 
them.
	--Mark 10:1
%
Some Pharisees came and tested him by asking, “Is it lawful for a man to 
divorce his wife?”
	--Mark 10:2
%
“What did Moses command you?” he replied.
	--Mark 10:3
%
They said, “Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce and send 
her away.”
	--Mark 10:4
%
“It was because your hearts were hard that Moses wrote you this law,” Jesus 
replied.
	--Mark 10:5
%
“But at the beginning of creation God ‘made them male and female.’
	--Mark 10:6
%
‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his 
wife,
	--Mark 10:7
%
and the two will become one flesh.’ So they are no longer two, but one flesh.
	--Mark 10:8
%
Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.”
	--Mark 10:9
%
When they were in the house again, the disciples asked Jesus about this.
	--Mark 10:10
%
He answered, “Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits 
adultery against her.
	--Mark 10:11
%
And if she divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits 
adultery.”
	--Mark 10:12
%
People were bringing little children to Jesus for him to place his hands on 
them, but the disciples rebuked them.
	--Mark 10:13
%
When Jesus saw this, he was indignant. He said to them, “Let the little 
children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to 
such as these.
	--Mark 10:14
%
Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little 
child will never enter it.”
	--Mark 10:15
%
And he took the children in his arms, placed his hands on them and blessed them.
	--Mark 10:16
%
As Jesus started on his way, a man ran up to him and fell on his knees before 
him. “Good teacher,” he asked, “what must I do to inherit eternal life?”
	--Mark 10:17
%
“Why do you call me good?” Jesus answered. “No one is good—except God 
alone.
	--Mark 10:18
%
You know the commandments: ‘You shall not murder, you shall not commit 
adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, you shall 
not defraud, honor your father and mother.’”
	--Mark 10:19
%
“Teacher,” he declared, “all these I have kept since I was a boy.”
	--Mark 10:20
%
Jesus looked at him and loved him. “One thing you lack,” he said. “Go, 
sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in 
heaven. Then come, follow me.”
	--Mark 10:21
%
At this the man’s face fell. He went away sad, because he had great wealth.
	--Mark 10:22
%
Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, “How hard it is for the rich 
to enter the kingdom of God!”
	--Mark 10:23
%
The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again, “Children, how 
hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!
	--Mark 10:24
%
It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who 
is rich to enter the kingdom of God.”
	--Mark 10:25
%
The disciples were even more amazed, and said to each other, “Who then can be 
saved?”
	--Mark 10:26
%
Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but not with 
God; all things are possible with God.”
	--Mark 10:27
%
Then Peter spoke up, “We have left everything to follow you!”
	--Mark 10:28
%
“Truly I tell you,” Jesus replied, “no one who has left home or brothers 
or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for me and the gospel
	--Mark 10:29
%
will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age: homes, 
brothers, sisters, mothers, children and fields—along with persecutions—and 
in the age to come eternal life.
	--Mark 10:30
%
But many who are first will be last, and the last first.”
	--Mark 10:31
%
They were on their way up to Jerusalem, with Jesus leading the way, and the 
disciples were astonished, while those who followed were afraid. Again he took 
the Twelve aside and told them what was going to happen to him.
	--Mark 10:32
%
“We are going up to Jerusalem,” he said, “and the Son of Man will be 
delivered over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will 
condemn him to death and will hand him over to the Gentiles,
	--Mark 10:33
%
who will mock him and spit on him, flog him and kill him. Three days later he 
will rise.”
	--Mark 10:34
%
Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him. “Teacher,” they 
said, “we want you to do for us whatever we ask.”
	--Mark 10:35
%
“What do you want me to do for you?” he asked.
	--Mark 10:36
%
They replied, “Let one of us sit at your right and the other at your left in 
your glory.”
	--Mark 10:37
%
“You don’t know what you are asking,” Jesus said. “Can you drink the 
cup I drink or be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?”
	--Mark 10:38
%
“We can,” they answered. Jesus said to them, “You will drink the cup I 
drink and be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with,
	--Mark 10:39
%
but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to 
those for whom they have been prepared.”
	--Mark 10:40
%
When the ten heard about this, they became indignant with James and John.
	--Mark 10:41
%
Jesus called them together and said, “You know that those who are regarded as 
rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise 
authority over them.
	--Mark 10:42
%
Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your 
servant,
	--Mark 10:43
%
and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all.
	--Mark 10:44
%
For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give 
his life as a ransom for many.”
	--Mark 10:45
%
Then they came to Jericho. As Jesus and his disciples, together with a large 
crowd, were leaving the city, a blind man, Bartimaeus (which means “son of 
Timaeus”), was sitting by the roadside begging.
	--Mark 10:46
%
When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout, “Jesus, Son 
of David, have mercy on me!”
	--Mark 10:47
%
Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, “Son 
of David, have mercy on me!”
	--Mark 10:48
%
Jesus stopped and said, “Call him.” So they called to the blind man, 
“Cheer up! On your feet! He’s calling you.”
	--Mark 10:49
%
Throwing his cloak aside, he jumped to his feet and came to Jesus.
	--Mark 10:50
%
“What do you want me to do for you?” Jesus asked him. The blind man said, 
“Rabbi, I want to see.”
	--Mark 10:51
%
“Go,” said Jesus, “your faith has healed you.” Immediately he received 
his sight and followed Jesus along the road.
	--Mark 10:52
%
As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of 
Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples,
	--Mark 11:1
%
saying to them, “Go to the village ahead of you, and just as you enter it, 
you will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and 
bring it here.
	--Mark 11:2
%
If anyone asks you, ‘Why are you doing this?’ say, ‘The Lord needs it and 
will send it back here shortly.’”
	--Mark 11:3
%
They went and found a colt outside in the street, tied at a doorway. As they 
untied it,
	--Mark 11:4
%
some people standing there asked, “What are you doing, untying that colt?”
	--Mark 11:5
%
They answered as Jesus had told them to, and the people let them go.
	--Mark 11:6
%
When they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks over it, he sat on 
it.
	--Mark 11:7
%
Many people spread their cloaks on the road, while others spread branches they 
had cut in the fields.
	--Mark 11:8
%
Those who went ahead and those who followed shouted, “Hosanna!” “Blessed 
is he who comes in the name of the Lord!”
	--Mark 11:9
%
“Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David!” “Hosanna in the 
highest heaven!”
	--Mark 11:10
%
Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the temple courts. He looked around at 
everything, but since it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the 
Twelve.
	--Mark 11:11
%
The next day as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus was hungry.
	--Mark 11:12
%
Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to find out if it had any 
fruit. When he reached it, he found nothing but leaves, because it was not the 
season for figs.
	--Mark 11:13
%
Then he said to the tree, “May no one ever eat fruit from you again.” And 
his disciples heard him say it.
	--Mark 11:14
%
On reaching Jerusalem, Jesus entered the temple courts and began driving out 
those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money 
changers and the benches of those selling doves,
	--Mark 11:15
%
and would not allow anyone to carry merchandise through the temple courts.
	--Mark 11:16
%
And as he taught them, he said, “Is it not written: ‘My house will be 
called a house of prayer for all nations’? But you have made it ‘a den of 
robbers.’”
	--Mark 11:17
%
The chief priests and the teachers of the law heard this and began looking for 
a way to kill him, for they feared him, because the whole crowd was amazed at 
his teaching.
	--Mark 11:18
%
When evening came, Jesus and his disciples went out of the city.
	--Mark 11:19
%
In the morning, as they went along, they saw the fig tree withered from the 
roots.
	--Mark 11:20
%
Peter remembered and said to Jesus, “Rabbi, look! The fig tree you cursed has 
withered!”
	--Mark 11:21
%
“Have faith in God,” Jesus answered.
	--Mark 11:22
%
“Truly I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself 
into the sea,’ and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they 
say will happen, it will be done for them.
	--Mark 11:23
%
Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have 
received it, and it will be yours.
	--Mark 11:24
%
And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive them, 
so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins.”
	--Mark 11:25
%

	--Mark 11:26
%
They arrived again in Jerusalem, and while Jesus was walking in the temple 
courts, the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders came to him.
	--Mark 11:27
%
“By what authority are you doing these things?” they asked. “And who gave 
you authority to do this?”
	--Mark 11:28
%
Jesus replied, “I will ask you one question. Answer me, and I will tell you 
by what authority I am doing these things.
	--Mark 11:29
%
John’s baptism—was it from heaven, or of human origin? Tell me!”
	--Mark 11:30
%
They discussed it among themselves and said, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ 
he will ask, ‘Then why didn’t you believe him?’
	--Mark 11:31
%
But if we say, ‘Of human origin’ …” (They feared the people, for 
everyone held that John really was a prophet.)
	--Mark 11:32
%
So they answered Jesus, “We don’t know.” Jesus said, “Neither will I 
tell you by what authority I am doing these things.”
	--Mark 11:33
%
Jesus then began to speak to them in parables: “A man planted a vineyard. He 
put a wall around it, dug a pit for the winepress and built a watchtower. Then 
he rented the vineyard to some farmers and moved to another place.
	--Mark 12:1
%
At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants to collect from them some of 
the fruit of the vineyard.
	--Mark 12:2
%
But they seized him, beat him and sent him away empty-handed.
	--Mark 12:3
%
Then he sent another servant to them; they struck this man on the head and 
treated him shamefully.
	--Mark 12:4
%
He sent still another, and that one they killed. He sent many others; some of 
them they beat, others they killed.
	--Mark 12:5
%
“He had one left to send, a son, whom he loved. He sent him last of all, 
saying, ‘They will respect my son.’
	--Mark 12:6
%
“But the tenants said to one another, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill 
him, and the inheritance will be ours.’
	--Mark 12:7
%
So they took him and killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard.
	--Mark 12:8
%
“What then will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and kill those 
tenants and give the vineyard to others.
	--Mark 12:9
%
Haven’t you read this passage of Scripture: “‘The stone the builders 
rejected has become the cornerstone;
	--Mark 12:10
%
the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes’?”
	--Mark 12:11
%
Then the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders looked for a way 
to arrest him because they knew he had spoken the parable against them. But 
they were afraid of the crowd; so they left him and went away.
	--Mark 12:12
%
Later they sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Jesus to catch him in 
his words.
	--Mark 12:13
%
They came to him and said, “Teacher, we know that you are a man of integrity. 
You aren’t swayed by others, because you pay no attention to who they are; 
but you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. Is it right to pay 
the imperial tax to Caesar or not?
	--Mark 12:14
%
Should we pay or shouldn’t we?” But Jesus knew their hypocrisy. “Why are 
you trying to trap me?” he asked. “Bring me a denarius and let me look at 
it.”
	--Mark 12:15
%
They brought the coin, and he asked them, “Whose image is this? And whose 
inscription?” “Caesar’s,” they replied.
	--Mark 12:16
%
Then Jesus said to them, “Give back to Caesar what is Caesar’s and to God 
what is God’s.” And they were amazed at him.
	--Mark 12:17
%
Then the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a 
question.
	--Mark 12:18
%
“Teacher,” they said, “Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies 
and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and raise up 
offspring for his brother.
	--Mark 12:19
%
Now there were seven brothers. The first one married and died without leaving 
any children.
	--Mark 12:20
%
The second one married the widow, but he also died, leaving no child. It was 
the same with the third.
	--Mark 12:21
%
In fact, none of the seven left any children. Last of all, the woman died too.
	--Mark 12:22
%
At the resurrection whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to 
her?”
	--Mark 12:23
%
Jesus replied, “Are you not in error because you do not know the Scriptures 
or the power of God?
	--Mark 12:24
%
When the dead rise, they will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will 
be like the angels in heaven.
	--Mark 12:25
%
Now about the dead rising—have you not read in the Book of Moses, in the 
account of the burning bush, how God said to him, ‘I am the God of Abraham, 
the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’?
	--Mark 12:26
%
He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are badly mistaken!”
	--Mark 12:27
%
One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing that 
Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, “Of all the commandments, 
which is the most important?”
	--Mark 12:28
%
“The most important one,” answered Jesus, “is this: ‘Hear, O Israel: 
The Lord our God, the Lord is one.
	--Mark 12:29
%
Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all 
your mind and with all your strength.’
	--Mark 12:30
%
The second is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no 
commandment greater than these.”
	--Mark 12:31
%
“Well said, teacher,” the man replied. “You are right in saying that God 
is one and there is no other but him.
	--Mark 12:32
%
To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding and with all your 
strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all 
burnt offerings and sacrifices.”
	--Mark 12:33
%
When Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, “You are not far 
from the kingdom of God.” And from then on no one dared ask him any more 
questions.
	--Mark 12:34
%
While Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, he asked, “Why do the teachers 
of the law say that the Messiah is the son of David?
	--Mark 12:35
%
David himself, speaking by the Holy Spirit, declared: “‘The Lord said to my 
Lord: “Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet.”’
	--Mark 12:36
%
David himself calls him ‘Lord.’ How then can he be his son?” The large 
crowd listened to him with delight.
	--Mark 12:37
%
As he taught, Jesus said, “Watch out for the teachers of the law. They like 
to walk around in flowing robes and be greeted with respect in the marketplaces,
	--Mark 12:38
%
and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at 
banquets.
	--Mark 12:39
%
They devour widows’ houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. These men 
will be punished most severely.”
	--Mark 12:40
%
Jesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and watched the 
crowd putting their money into the temple treasury. Many rich people threw in 
large amounts.
	--Mark 12:41
%
But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins, worth only a few 
cents.
	--Mark 12:42
%
Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said, “Truly I tell you, this poor widow 
has put more into the treasury than all the others.
	--Mark 12:43
%
They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in 
everything—all she had to live on.”
	--Mark 12:44
%
As Jesus was leaving the temple, one of his disciples said to him, “Look, 
Teacher! What massive stones! What magnificent buildings!”
	--Mark 13:1
%
“Do you see all these great buildings?” replied Jesus. “Not one stone 
here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down.”
	--Mark 13:2
%
As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, 
John and Andrew asked him privately,
	--Mark 13:3
%
“Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they 
are all about to be fulfilled?”
	--Mark 13:4
%
Jesus said to them: “Watch out that no one deceives you.
	--Mark 13:5
%
Many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am he,’ and will deceive many.
	--Mark 13:6
%
When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed. Such things must 
happen, but the end is still to come.
	--Mark 13:7
%
Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be 
earthquakes in various places, and famines. These are the beginning of birth 
pains.
	--Mark 13:8
%
“You must be on your guard. You will be handed over to the local councils and 
flogged in the synagogues. On account of me you will stand before governors and 
kings as witnesses to them.
	--Mark 13:9
%
And the gospel must first be preached to all nations.
	--Mark 13:10
%
Whenever you are arrested and brought to trial, do not worry beforehand about 
what to say. Just say whatever is given you at the time, for it is not you 
speaking, but the Holy Spirit.
	--Mark 13:11
%
“Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child. Children will 
rebel against their parents and have them put to death.
	--Mark 13:12
%
Everyone will hate you because of me, but the one who stands firm to the end 
will be saved.
	--Mark 13:13
%
“When you see ‘the abomination that causes desolation’ standing where it 
does not belong—let the reader understand—then let those who are in Judea 
flee to the mountains.
	--Mark 13:14
%
Let no one on the housetop go down or enter the house to take anything out.
	--Mark 13:15
%
Let no one in the field go back to get their cloak.
	--Mark 13:16
%
How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers!
	--Mark 13:17
%
Pray that this will not take place in winter,
	--Mark 13:18
%
because those will be days of distress unequaled from the beginning, when God 
created the world, until now—and never to be equaled again.
	--Mark 13:19
%
“If the Lord had not cut short those days, no one would survive. But for the 
sake of the elect, whom he has chosen, he has shortened them.
	--Mark 13:20
%
At that time if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Messiah!’ or, 
‘Look, there he is!’ do not believe it.
	--Mark 13:21
%
For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform signs and wonders 
to deceive, if possible, even the elect.
	--Mark 13:22
%
So be on your guard; I have told you everything ahead of time.
	--Mark 13:23
%
“But in those days, following that distress, “‘the sun will be darkened, 
and the moon will not give its light;
	--Mark 13:24
%
the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.’
	--Mark 13:25
%
“At that time people will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great 
power and glory.
	--Mark 13:26
%
And he will send his angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from the 
ends of the earth to the ends of the heavens.
	--Mark 13:27
%
“Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and 
its leaves come out, you know that summer is near.
	--Mark 13:28
%
Even so, when you see these things happening, you know that it is near, right 
at the door.
	--Mark 13:29
%
Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these 
things have happened.
	--Mark 13:30
%
Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.
	--Mark 13:31
%
“But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor 
the Son, but only the Father.
	--Mark 13:32
%
Be on guard! Be alert! You do not know when that time will come.
	--Mark 13:33
%
It’s like a man going away: He leaves his house and puts his servants in 
charge, each with their assigned task, and tells the one at the door to keep 
watch.
	--Mark 13:34
%
“Therefore keep watch because you do not know when the owner of the house 
will come back—whether in the evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster 
crows, or at dawn.
	--Mark 13:35
%
If he comes suddenly, do not let him find you sleeping.
	--Mark 13:36
%
What I say to you, I say to everyone: ‘Watch!’”
	--Mark 13:37
%
Now the Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread were only two days away, 
and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were scheming to arrest Jesus 
secretly and kill him.
	--Mark 14:1
%
“But not during the festival,” they said, “or the people may riot.”
	--Mark 14:2
%
While he was in Bethany, reclining at the table in the home of Simon the Leper, 
a woman came with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, made of pure 
nard. She broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head.
	--Mark 14:3
%
Some of those present were saying indignantly to one another, “Why this waste 
of perfume?
	--Mark 14:4
%
It could have been sold for more than a year’s wages and the money given to 
the poor.” And they rebuked her harshly.
	--Mark 14:5
%
“Leave her alone,” said Jesus. “Why are you bothering her? She has done a 
beautiful thing to me.
	--Mark 14:6
%
The poor you will always have with you, and you can help them any time you 
want. But you will not always have me.
	--Mark 14:7
%
She did what she could. She poured perfume on my body beforehand to prepare for 
my burial.
	--Mark 14:8
%
Truly I tell you, wherever the gospel is preached throughout the world, what 
she has done will also be told, in memory of her.”
	--Mark 14:9
%
Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the chief priests to betray 
Jesus to them.
	--Mark 14:10
%
They were delighted to hear this and promised to give him money. So he watched 
for an opportunity to hand him over.
	--Mark 14:11
%
On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, when it was customary to 
sacrifice the Passover lamb, Jesus’ disciples asked him, “Where do you want 
us to go and make preparations for you to eat the Passover?”
	--Mark 14:12
%
So he sent two of his disciples, telling them, “Go into the city, and a man 
carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him.
	--Mark 14:13
%
Say to the owner of the house he enters, ‘The Teacher asks: Where is my guest 
room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?’
	--Mark 14:14
%
He will show you a large room upstairs, furnished and ready. Make preparations 
for us there.”
	--Mark 14:15
%
The disciples left, went into the city and found things just as Jesus had told 
them. So they prepared the Passover.
	--Mark 14:16
%
When evening came, Jesus arrived with the Twelve.
	--Mark 14:17
%
While they were reclining at the table eating, he said, “Truly I tell you, 
one of you will betray me—one who is eating with me.”
	--Mark 14:18
%
They were saddened, and one by one they said to him, “Surely you don’t mean 
me?”
	--Mark 14:19
%
“It is one of the Twelve,” he replied, “one who dips bread into the bowl 
with me.
	--Mark 14:20
%
The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who 
betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.”
	--Mark 14:21
%
While they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, he 
broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, “Take it; this is my body.”
	--Mark 14:22
%
Then he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and they 
all drank from it.
	--Mark 14:23
%
“This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many,” he said 
to them.
	--Mark 14:24
%
“Truly I tell you, I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until 
that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.”
	--Mark 14:25
%
When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
	--Mark 14:26
%
“You will all fall away,” Jesus told them, “for it is written: “‘I 
will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.’
	--Mark 14:27
%
But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.”
	--Mark 14:28
%
Peter declared, “Even if all fall away, I will not.”
	--Mark 14:29
%
“Truly I tell you,” Jesus answered, “today—yes, tonight—before the 
rooster crows twice you yourself will disown me three times.”
	--Mark 14:30
%
But Peter insisted emphatically, “Even if I have to die with you, I will 
never disown you.” And all the others said the same.
	--Mark 14:31
%
They went to a place called Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his disciples, “Sit 
here while I pray.”
	--Mark 14:32
%
He took Peter, James and John along with him, and he began to be deeply 
distressed and troubled.
	--Mark 14:33
%
“My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death,” he said to 
them. “Stay here and keep watch.”
	--Mark 14:34
%
Going a little farther, he fell to the ground and prayed that if possible the 
hour might pass from him.
	--Mark 14:35
%
“Abba, Father,” he said, “everything is possible for you. Take this cup 
from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will.”
	--Mark 14:36
%
Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. “Simon,” he said 
to Peter, “are you asleep? Couldn’t you keep watch for one hour?
	--Mark 14:37
%
Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is 
willing, but the flesh is weak.”
	--Mark 14:38
%
Once more he went away and prayed the same thing.
	--Mark 14:39
%
When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. 
They did not know what to say to him.
	--Mark 14:40
%
Returning the third time, he said to them, “Are you still sleeping and 
resting? Enough! The hour has come. Look, the Son of Man is delivered into the 
hands of sinners.
	--Mark 14:41
%
Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!”
	--Mark 14:42
%
Just as he was speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, appeared. With him was a 
crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests, the teachers of 
the law, and the elders.
	--Mark 14:43
%
Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: “The one I kiss is the man; 
arrest him and lead him away under guard.”
	--Mark 14:44
%
Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, “Rabbi!” and kissed him.
	--Mark 14:45
%
The men seized Jesus and arrested him.
	--Mark 14:46
%
Then one of those standing near drew his sword and struck the servant of the 
high priest, cutting off his ear.
	--Mark 14:47
%
“Am I leading a rebellion,” said Jesus, “that you have come out with 
swords and clubs to capture me?
	--Mark 14:48
%
Every day I was with you, teaching in the temple courts, and you did not arrest 
me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled.”
	--Mark 14:49
%
Then everyone deserted him and fled.
	--Mark 14:50
%
A young man, wearing nothing but a linen garment, was following Jesus. When 
they seized him,
	--Mark 14:51
%
he fled naked, leaving his garment behind.
	--Mark 14:52
%
They took Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests, the elders and 
the teachers of the law came together.
	--Mark 14:53
%
Peter followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. 
There he sat with the guards and warmed himself at the fire.
	--Mark 14:54
%
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against 
Jesus so that they could put him to death, but they did not find any.
	--Mark 14:55
%
Many testified falsely against him, but their statements did not agree.
	--Mark 14:56
%
Then some stood up and gave this false testimony against him:
	--Mark 14:57
%
“We heard him say, ‘I will destroy this temple made with human hands and in 
three days will build another, not made with hands.’”
	--Mark 14:58
%
Yet even then their testimony did not agree.
	--Mark 14:59
%
Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, “Are you not going 
to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?”
	--Mark 14:60
%
But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer. Again the high priest asked him, 
“Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?”
	--Mark 14:61
%
“I am,” said Jesus. “And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right 
hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.”
	--Mark 14:62
%
The high priest tore his clothes. “Why do we need any more witnesses?” he 
asked.
	--Mark 14:63
%
“You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?” They all condemned him 
as worthy of death.
	--Mark 14:64
%
Then some began to spit at him; they blindfolded him, struck him with their 
fists, and said, “Prophesy!” And the guards took him and beat him.
	--Mark 14:65
%
While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high 
priest came by.
	--Mark 14:66
%
When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked closely at him. “You also were 
with that Nazarene, Jesus,” she said.
	--Mark 14:67
%
But he denied it. “I don’t know or understand what you’re talking 
about,” he said, and went out into the entryway.
	--Mark 14:68
%
When the servant girl saw him there, she said again to those standing around, 
“This fellow is one of them.”
	--Mark 14:69
%
Again he denied it. After a little while, those standing near said to Peter, 
“Surely you are one of them, for you are a Galilean.”
	--Mark 14:70
%
He began to call down curses, and he swore to them, “I don’t know this man 
you’re talking about.”
	--Mark 14:71
%
Immediately the rooster crowed the second time. Then Peter remembered the word 
Jesus had spoken to him: “Before the rooster crows twice you will disown me 
three times.” And he broke down and wept.
	--Mark 14:72
%
Very early in the morning, the chief priests, with the elders, the teachers of 
the law and the whole Sanhedrin, made their plans. So they bound Jesus, led him 
away and handed him over to Pilate.
	--Mark 15:1
%
“Are you the king of the Jews?” asked Pilate. “You have said so,” Jesus 
replied.
	--Mark 15:2
%
The chief priests accused him of many things.
	--Mark 15:3
%
So again Pilate asked him, “Aren’t you going to answer? See how many things 
they are accusing you of.”
	--Mark 15:4
%
But Jesus still made no reply, and Pilate was amazed.
	--Mark 15:5
%
Now it was the custom at the festival to release a prisoner whom the people 
requested.
	--Mark 15:6
%
A man called Barabbas was in prison with the insurrectionists who had committed 
murder in the uprising.
	--Mark 15:7
%
The crowd came up and asked Pilate to do for them what he usually did.
	--Mark 15:8
%
“Do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews?” asked Pilate,
	--Mark 15:9
%
knowing it was out of self-interest that the chief priests had handed Jesus 
over to him.
	--Mark 15:10
%
But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have Pilate release Barabbas 
instead.
	--Mark 15:11
%
“What shall I do, then, with the one you call the king of the Jews?” Pilate 
asked them.
	--Mark 15:12
%
“Crucify him!” they shouted.
	--Mark 15:13
%
“Why? What crime has he committed?” asked Pilate. But they shouted all the 
louder, “Crucify him!”
	--Mark 15:14
%
Wanting to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. He had Jesus 
flogged, and handed him over to be crucified.
	--Mark 15:15
%
The soldiers led Jesus away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium) and 
called together the whole company of soldiers.
	--Mark 15:16
%
They put a purple robe on him, then twisted together a crown of thorns and set 
it on him.
	--Mark 15:17
%
And they began to call out to him, “Hail, king of the Jews!”
	--Mark 15:18
%
Again and again they struck him on the head with a staff and spit on him. 
Falling on their knees, they paid homage to him.
	--Mark 15:19
%
And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple robe and put his own 
clothes on him. Then they led him out to crucify him.
	--Mark 15:20
%
A certain man from Cyrene, Simon, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was 
passing by on his way in from the country, and they forced him to carry the 
cross.
	--Mark 15:21
%
They brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha (which means “the place of 
the skull”).
	--Mark 15:22
%
Then they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it.
	--Mark 15:23
%
And they crucified him. Dividing up his clothes, they cast lots to see what 
each would get.
	--Mark 15:24
%
It was nine in the morning when they crucified him.
	--Mark 15:25
%
The written notice of the charge against him read: the king of the jews.
	--Mark 15:26
%
They crucified two rebels with him, one on his right and one on his left.
	--Mark 15:27
%

	--Mark 15:28
%
Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads and saying, 
“So! You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days,
	--Mark 15:29
%
come down from the cross and save yourself!”
	--Mark 15:30
%
In the same way the chief priests and the teachers of the law mocked him among 
themselves. “He saved others,” they said, “but he can’t save himself!
	--Mark 15:31
%
Let this Messiah, this king of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we 
may see and believe.” Those crucified with him also heaped insults on him.
	--Mark 15:32
%
At noon, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon.
	--Mark 15:33
%
And at three in the afternoon Jesus cried out in a loud voice, “Eloi, Eloi, 
lema sabachthani?” (which means “My God, my God, why have you forsaken 
me?”).
	--Mark 15:34
%
When some of those standing near heard this, they said, “Listen, he’s 
calling Elijah.”
	--Mark 15:35
%
Someone ran, filled a sponge with wine vinegar, put it on a staff, and offered 
it to Jesus to drink. “Now leave him alone. Let’s see if Elijah comes to 
take him down,” he said.
	--Mark 15:36
%
With a loud cry, Jesus breathed his last.
	--Mark 15:37
%
The curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.
	--Mark 15:38
%
And when the centurion, who stood there in front of Jesus, saw how he died, he 
said, “Surely this man was the Son of God!”
	--Mark 15:39
%
Some women were watching from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary 
the mother of James the younger and of Joseph, and Salome.
	--Mark 15:40
%
In Galilee these women had followed him and cared for his needs. Many other 
women who had come up with him to Jerusalem were also there.
	--Mark 15:41
%
It was Preparation Day (that is, the day before the Sabbath). So as evening 
approached,
	--Mark 15:42
%
Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the Council, who was himself waiting 
for the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate and asked for Jesus’ body.
	--Mark 15:43
%
Pilate was surprised to hear that he was already dead. Summoning the centurion, 
he asked him if Jesus had already died.
	--Mark 15:44
%
When he learned from the centurion that it was so, he gave the body to Joseph.
	--Mark 15:45
%
So Joseph bought some linen cloth, took down the body, wrapped it in the linen, 
and placed it in a tomb cut out of rock. Then he rolled a stone against the 
entrance of the tomb.
	--Mark 15:46
%
Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joseph saw where he was laid.
	--Mark 15:47
%
When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome 
bought spices so that they might go to anoint Jesus’ body.
	--Mark 16:1
%
Very early on the first day of the week, just after sunrise, they were on their 
way to the tomb
	--Mark 16:2
%
and they asked each other, “Who will roll the stone away from the entrance of 
the tomb?”
	--Mark 16:3
%
But when they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had 
been rolled away.
	--Mark 16:4
%
As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting 
on the right side, and they were alarmed.
	--Mark 16:5
%
“Don’t be alarmed,” he said. “You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, 
who was crucified. He has risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid 
him.
	--Mark 16:6
%
But go, tell his disciples and Peter, ‘He is going ahead of you into Galilee. 
There you will see him, just as he told you.’”
	--Mark 16:7
%
Trembling and bewildered, the women went out and fled from the tomb. They said 
nothing to anyone, because they were afraid.
	--Mark 16:8
%
[The earliest manuscripts and some other ancient witnesses do not have verses 
9–20.] When Jesus rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first 
to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had driven seven demons.
	--Mark 16:9
%
She went and told those who had been with him and who were mourning and weeping.
	--Mark 16:10
%
When they heard that Jesus was alive and that she had seen him, they did not 
believe it.
	--Mark 16:11
%
Afterward Jesus appeared in a different form to two of them while they were 
walking in the country.
	--Mark 16:12
%
These returned and reported it to the rest; but they did not believe them 
either.
	--Mark 16:13
%
Later Jesus appeared to the Eleven as they were eating; he rebuked them for 
their lack of faith and their stubborn refusal to believe those who had seen 
him after he had risen.
	--Mark 16:14
%
He said to them, “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation.
	--Mark 16:15
%
Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe 
will be condemned.
	--Mark 16:16
%
And these signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive 
out demons; they will speak in new tongues;
	--Mark 16:17
%
they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, 
it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and 
they will get well.”
	--Mark 16:18
%
After the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven and he sat 
at the right hand of God.
	--Mark 16:19
%
Then the disciples went out and preached everywhere, and the Lord worked with 
them and confirmed his word by the signs that accompanied it.
	--Mark 16:20
%
This is the genealogy of Jesus the Messiah the son of David, the son of Abraham:
	--Matthew 1:1
%
Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, Jacob the father of 
Judah and his brothers,
	--Matthew 1:2
%
Judah the father of Perez and Zerah, whose mother was Tamar, Perez the father 
of Hezron, Hezron the father of Ram,
	--Matthew 1:3
%
Ram the father of Amminadab, Amminadab the father of Nahshon, Nahshon the 
father of Salmon,
	--Matthew 1:4
%
Salmon the father of Boaz, whose mother was Rahab, Boaz the father of Obed, 
whose mother was Ruth, Obed the father of Jesse,
	--Matthew 1:5
%
and Jesse the father of King David. David was the father of Solomon, whose 
mother had been Uriah’s wife,
	--Matthew 1:6
%
Solomon the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, Abijah the 
father of Asa,
	--Matthew 1:7
%
Asa the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Jehoram, Jehoram the 
father of Uzziah,
	--Matthew 1:8
%
Uzziah the father of Jotham, Jotham the father of Ahaz, Ahaz the father of 
Hezekiah,
	--Matthew 1:9
%
Hezekiah the father of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of Amon, Amon the father 
of Josiah,
	--Matthew 1:10
%
and Josiah the father of Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the exile to 
Babylon.
	--Matthew 1:11
%
After the exile to Babylon: Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel, Shealtiel the 
father of Zerubbabel,
	--Matthew 1:12
%
Zerubbabel the father of Abihud, Abihud the father of Eliakim, Eliakim the 
father of Azor,
	--Matthew 1:13
%
Azor the father of Zadok, Zadok the father of Akim, Akim the father of Elihud,
	--Matthew 1:14
%
Elihud the father of Eleazar, Eleazar the father of Matthan, Matthan the father 
of Jacob,
	--Matthew 1:15
%
and Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, and Mary was the mother of 
Jesus who is called the Messiah.
	--Matthew 1:16
%
Thus there were fourteen generations in all from Abraham to David, fourteen 
from David to the exile to Babylon, and fourteen from the exile to the Messiah.
	--Matthew 1:17
%
This is how the birth of Jesus the Messiah came about: His mother Mary was 
pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found 
to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit.
	--Matthew 1:18
%
Because Joseph her husband was faithful to the law, and yet did not want to 
expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly.
	--Matthew 1:19
%
But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a 
dream and said, “Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as 
your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
	--Matthew 1:20
%
She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because 
he will save his people from their sins.”
	--Matthew 1:21
%
All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet:
	--Matthew 1:22
%
“The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him 
Immanuel” (which means “God with us”).
	--Matthew 1:23
%
When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and 
took Mary home as his wife.
	--Matthew 1:24
%
But he did not consummate their marriage until she gave birth to a son. And he 
gave him the name Jesus.
	--Matthew 1:25
%
After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod, Magi 
from the east came to Jerusalem
	--Matthew 2:1
%
and asked, “Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? We saw his 
star when it rose and have come to worship him.”
	--Matthew 2:2
%
When King Herod heard this he was disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.
	--Matthew 2:3
%
When he had called together all the people’s chief priests and teachers of 
the law, he asked them where the Messiah was to be born.
	--Matthew 2:4
%
“In Bethlehem in Judea,” they replied, “for this is what the prophet has 
written:
	--Matthew 2:5
%
“‘But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the 
rulers of Judah; for out of you will come a ruler who will shepherd my people 
Israel.’”
	--Matthew 2:6
%
Then Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the 
star had appeared.
	--Matthew 2:7
%
He sent them to Bethlehem and said, “Go and search carefully for the child. 
As soon as you find him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship him.”
	--Matthew 2:8
%
After they had heard the king, they went on their way, and the star they had 
seen when it rose went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the 
child was.
	--Matthew 2:9
%
When they saw the star, they were overjoyed.
	--Matthew 2:10
%
On coming to the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they bowed 
down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with 
gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh.
	--Matthew 2:11
%
And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to 
their country by another route.
	--Matthew 2:12
%
When they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. “Get 
up,” he said, “take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay 
there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill 
him.”
	--Matthew 2:13
%
So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt,
	--Matthew 2:14
%
where he stayed until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord 
had said through the prophet: “Out of Egypt I called my son.”
	--Matthew 2:15
%
When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious, and 
he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two 
years old and under, in accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi.
	--Matthew 2:16
%
Then what was said through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:
	--Matthew 2:17
%
“A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for 
her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more.”
	--Matthew 2:18
%
After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt
	--Matthew 2:19
%
and said, “Get up, take the child and his mother and go to the land of 
Israel, for those who were trying to take the child’s life are dead.”
	--Matthew 2:20
%
So he got up, took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel.
	--Matthew 2:21
%
But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father 
Herod, he was afraid to go there. Having been warned in a dream, he withdrew to 
the district of Galilee,
	--Matthew 2:22
%
and he went and lived in a town called Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was said 
through the prophets, that he would be called a Nazarene.
	--Matthew 2:23
%
In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea
	--Matthew 3:1
%
and saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near.”
	--Matthew 3:2
%
This is he who was spoken of through the prophet Isaiah: “A voice of one 
calling in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths 
for him.’”
	--Matthew 3:3
%
John’s clothes were made of camel’s hair, and he had a leather belt around 
his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
	--Matthew 3:4
%
People went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea and the whole region of the 
Jordan.
	--Matthew 3:5
%
Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.
	--Matthew 3:6
%
But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was 
baptizing, he said to them: “You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from 
the coming wrath?
	--Matthew 3:7
%
Produce fruit in keeping with repentance.
	--Matthew 3:8
%
And do not think you can say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our 
father.’ I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for 
Abraham.
	--Matthew 3:9
%
The ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not 
produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.
	--Matthew 3:10
%
“I baptize you with water for repentance. But after me comes one who is more 
powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you 
with the Holy Spirit and fire.
	--Matthew 3:11
%
His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor, 
gathering his wheat into the barn and burning up the chaff with unquenchable 
fire.”
	--Matthew 3:12
%
Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John.
	--Matthew 3:13
%
But John tried to deter him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and do 
you come to me?”
	--Matthew 3:14
%
Jesus replied, “Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill 
all righteousness.” Then John consented.
	--Matthew 3:15
%
As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment 
heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and 
alighting on him.
	--Matthew 3:16
%
And a voice from heaven said, “This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am 
well pleased.”
	--Matthew 3:17
%
Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
	--Matthew 4:1
%
After fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry.
	--Matthew 4:2
%
The tempter came to him and said, “If you are the Son of God, tell these 
stones to become bread.”
	--Matthew 4:3
%
Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone, but on 
every word that comes from the mouth of God.’”
	--Matthew 4:4
%
Then the devil took him to the holy city and had him stand on the highest point 
of the temple.
	--Matthew 4:5
%
“If you are the Son of God,” he said, “throw yourself down. For it is 
written: “‘He will command his angels concerning you, and they will lift 
you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a 
stone.’”
	--Matthew 4:6
%
Jesus answered him, “It is also written: ‘Do not put the Lord your God to 
the test.’”
	--Matthew 4:7
%
Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the 
kingdoms of the world and their splendor.
	--Matthew 4:8
%
“All this I will give you,” he said, “if you will bow down and worship 
me.”
	--Matthew 4:9
%
Jesus said to him, “Away from me, Satan! For it is written: ‘Worship the 
Lord your God, and serve him only.’”
	--Matthew 4:10
%
Then the devil left him, and angels came and attended him.
	--Matthew 4:11
%
When Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he withdrew to Galilee.
	--Matthew 4:12
%
Leaving Nazareth, he went and lived in Capernaum, which was by the lake in the 
area of Zebulun and Naphtali—
	--Matthew 4:13
%
to fulfill what was said through the prophet Isaiah:
	--Matthew 4:14
%
“Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, the Way of the Sea, beyond the Jordan, 
Galilee of the Gentiles—
	--Matthew 4:15
%
the people living in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the 
land of the shadow of death a light has dawned.”
	--Matthew 4:16
%
From that time on Jesus began to preach, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven 
has come near.”
	--Matthew 4:17
%
As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon 
called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for 
they were fishermen.
	--Matthew 4:18
%
“Come, follow me,” Jesus said, “and I will send you out to fish for 
people.”
	--Matthew 4:19
%
At once they left their nets and followed him.
	--Matthew 4:20
%
Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his 
brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, preparing their 
nets. Jesus called them,
	--Matthew 4:21
%
and immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him.
	--Matthew 4:22
%
Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the 
good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the 
people.
	--Matthew 4:23
%
News about him spread all over Syria, and people brought to him all who were 
ill with various diseases, those suffering severe pain, the demon-possessed, 
those having seizures, and the paralyzed; and he healed them.
	--Matthew 4:24
%
Large crowds from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea and the region 
across the Jordan followed him.
	--Matthew 4:25
%
Now when Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on a mountainside and sat down. His 
disciples came to him,
	--Matthew 5:1
%
and he began to teach them. He said:
	--Matthew 5:2
%
“Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
	--Matthew 5:3
%
Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
	--Matthew 5:4
%
Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.
	--Matthew 5:5
%
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be 
filled.
	--Matthew 5:6
%
Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
	--Matthew 5:7
%
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.
	--Matthew 5:8
%
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.
	--Matthew 5:9
%
Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is 
the kingdom of heaven.
	--Matthew 5:10
%
“Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all 
kinds of evil against you because of me.
	--Matthew 5:11
%
Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same 
way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
	--Matthew 5:12
%
“You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can 
it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown 
out and trampled underfoot.
	--Matthew 5:13
%
“You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden.
	--Matthew 5:14
%
Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on 
its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house.
	--Matthew 5:15
%
In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your 
good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.
	--Matthew 5:16
%
“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not 
come to abolish them but to fulfill them.
	--Matthew 5:17
%
For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest 
letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law 
until everything is accomplished.
	--Matthew 5:18
%
Therefore anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches 
others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever 
practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of 
heaven.
	--Matthew 5:19
%
For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees 
and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.
	--Matthew 5:20
%
“You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, ‘You shall not 
murder, and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.’
	--Matthew 5:21
%
But I tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother or sister will be 
subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to a brother or sister, ‘Raca,’ 
is answerable to the court. And anyone who says, ‘You fool!’ will be in 
danger of the fire of hell.

“Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember 
that your brother or sister has something against you,

“Settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court. Do it

If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is 
better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be

commits adultery.

“Again, you have heard that it was said to the people long ago, ‘Do not 
break your oath, but fulfill to the Lord the vows you have made.’

But I tell you, do not swear an oath at all: either by heaven, for it is 
God’s throne;

or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city 
of the Great King.

If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax

hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by others.

%
But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right 
hand is doing,

in secret, will reward you.

“This, then, is how you should pray: “‘Our Father in heaven, hallowed be

And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.

drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and 
the body more than clothes?

Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, 
and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than 
they?

%
Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life?
	--Matthew 6:27
%
“And why do you worry about clothes? See how the flowers of the field grow. 
They do not labor or spin.
	--Matthew 6:28
%
Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one 
of these.
	--Matthew 6:29
%
If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and 
tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you—you of 
little faith?
	--Matthew 6:30
%
So do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ 
or ‘What shall we wear?’
	--Matthew 6:31
%
For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that 
you need them.
	--Matthew 6:32
%
But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be 
given to you as well.
	--Matthew 6:33

Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. 
Each day has enough trouble of its own.

“Do not judge, or you too will be judged.

“Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no

when all the time there is a plank in your own eye?

You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see 
clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.

Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.

A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.

Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.

Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them.

“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of

“Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice 
is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.

%
The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that 
house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock.
	--Matthew 7:25
%
But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice 
is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
	--Matthew 7:26
%
The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that 
house, and it fell with a great crash.”
	--Matthew 7:27
%
When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his 
teaching,
	--Matthew 7:28
%
because he taught as one who had authority, and not as their teachers of the 
law.
	--Matthew 7:29
%
When Jesus came down from the mountainside, large crowds followed him.
	--Matthew 8:1
%
A man with leprosy came and knelt before him and said, “Lord, if you are 
willing, you can make me clean.”
	--Matthew 8:2
%
Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. “I am willing,” he said. 
“Be clean!” Immediately he was cleansed of his leprosy.
	--Matthew 8:3
%
Then Jesus said to him, “See that you don’t tell anyone. But go, show 
yourself to the priest and offer the gift Moses commanded, as a testimony to 
them.”
	--Matthew 8:4
%
When Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking for help.
	--Matthew 8:5
%
“Lord,” he said, “my servant lies at home paralyzed, suffering 
terribly.”
	--Matthew 8:6
%
Jesus said to him, “Shall I come and heal him?”
	--Matthew 8:7
%
The centurion replied, “Lord, I do not deserve to have you come under my 
roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed.
	--Matthew 8:8
%
For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, 
‘Go,’ and he goes; and that one, ‘Come,’ and he comes. I say to my 
servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”
	--Matthew 8:9
%
When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those following him, “Truly 
I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith.
	--Matthew 8:10
%
I say to you that many will come from the east and the west, and will take 
their places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of 
heaven.
	--Matthew 8:11
%
But the subjects of the kingdom will be thrown outside, into the darkness, 
where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”
	--Matthew 8:12
%
Then Jesus said to the centurion, “Go! Let it be done just as you believed it 
would.” And his servant was healed at that moment.
	--Matthew 8:13
%
When Jesus came into Peter’s house, he saw Peter’s mother-in-law lying in 
bed with a fever.
	--Matthew 8:14
%
He touched her hand and the fever left her, and she got up and began to wait on 
him.
	--Matthew 8:15
%
When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to him, and he 
drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.
	--Matthew 8:16
%
This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: “He took up 
our infirmities and bore our diseases.”
	--Matthew 8:17
%
When Jesus saw the crowd around him, he gave orders to cross to the other side 
of the lake.
	--Matthew 8:18
%
Then a teacher of the law came to him and said, “Teacher, I will follow you 
wherever you go.”
	--Matthew 8:19
%
Jesus replied, “Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has 
no place to lay his head.”
	--Matthew 8:20
%
Another disciple said to him, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father.”
	--Matthew 8:21
%
But Jesus told him, “Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead.”
	--Matthew 8:22
%
Then he got into the boat and his disciples followed him.
	--Matthew 8:23
%
Suddenly a furious storm came up on the lake, so that the waves swept over the 
boat. But Jesus was sleeping.
	--Matthew 8:24
%
The disciples went and woke him, saying, “Lord, save us! We’re going to 
drown!”
	--Matthew 8:25
%
He replied, “You of little faith, why are you so afraid?” Then he got up 
and rebuked the winds and the waves, and it was completely calm.
	--Matthew 8:26
%
The men were amazed and asked, “What kind of man is this? Even the winds and 
the waves obey him!”
	--Matthew 8:27
%
When he arrived at the other side in the region of the Gadarenes, two 
demon-possessed men coming from the tombs met him. They were so violent that no 
one could pass that way.
	--Matthew 8:28
%
“What do you want with us, Son of God?” they shouted. “Have you come here 
to torture us before the appointed time?”
	--Matthew 8:29
%
Some distance from them a large herd of pigs was feeding.
	--Matthew 8:30
%
The demons begged Jesus, “If you drive us out, send us into the herd of 
pigs.”
	--Matthew 8:31
%
He said to them, “Go!” So they came out and went into the pigs, and the 
whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and died in the water.
	--Matthew 8:32
%
Those tending the pigs ran off, went into the town and reported all this, 
including what had happened to the demon-possessed men.
	--Matthew 8:33
%
Then the whole town went out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they pleaded 
with him to leave their region.
	--Matthew 8:34
%
Jesus stepped into a boat, crossed over and came to his own town.
	--Matthew 9:1
%
Some men brought to him a paralyzed man, lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their 
faith, he said to the man, “Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven.”
	--Matthew 9:2
%
At this, some of the teachers of the law said to themselves, “This fellow is 
blaspheming!”
	--Matthew 9:3
%
Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said, “Why do you entertain evil thoughts in 
your hearts?
	--Matthew 9:4
%
Which is easier: to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and 
walk’?
	--Matthew 9:5
%
But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive 
sins.” So he said to the paralyzed man, “Get up, take your mat and go 
home.”
	--Matthew 9:6
%
Then the man got up and went home.
	--Matthew 9:7
%
When the crowd saw this, they were filled with awe; and they praised God, who 
had given such authority to man.
	--Matthew 9:8
%
As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax 
collector’s booth. “Follow me,” he told him, and Matthew got up and 
followed him.
	--Matthew 9:9
%
While Jesus was having dinner at Matthew’s house, many tax collectors and 
sinners came and ate with him and his disciples.
	--Matthew 9:10
%
When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, “Why does your teacher 
eat with tax collectors and sinners?”
	--Matthew 9:11
%
On hearing this, Jesus said, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but 
the sick.
	--Matthew 9:12
%
But go and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice.’ For I 
have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”
	--Matthew 9:13
%
Then John’s disciples came and asked him, “How is it that we and the 
Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?”
	--Matthew 9:14
%
Jesus answered, “How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while he is with 
them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they 
will fast.
	--Matthew 9:15
%
“No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch will 
pull away from the garment, making the tear worse.
	--Matthew 9:16
%
Neither do people pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will 
burst; the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour 
new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.”
	--Matthew 9:17
%
While he was saying this, a synagogue leader came and knelt before him and 
said, “My daughter has just died. But come and put your hand on her, and she 
will live.”
	--Matthew 9:18
%
Jesus got up and went with him, and so did his disciples.
	--Matthew 9:19
%
Just then a woman who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years came up 
behind him and touched the edge of his cloak.
	--Matthew 9:20
%
She said to herself, “If I only touch his cloak, I will be healed.”
	--Matthew 9:21
%
Jesus turned and saw her. “Take heart, daughter,” he said, “your faith 
has healed you.” And the woman was healed at that moment.
	--Matthew 9:22
%
When Jesus entered the synagogue leader’s house and saw the noisy crowd and 
people playing pipes,
	--Matthew 9:23
%
he said, “Go away. The girl is not dead but asleep.” But they laughed at 
him.
	--Matthew 9:24
%
After the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took the girl by the hand, 
and she got up.
	--Matthew 9:25
%
News of this spread through all that region.
	--Matthew 9:26
%
As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him, calling out, “Have 
mercy on us, Son of David!”
	--Matthew 9:27
%
When he had gone indoors, the blind men came to him, and he asked them, “Do 
you believe that I am able to do this?” “Yes, Lord,” they replied.
	--Matthew 9:28
%
Then he touched their eyes and said, “According to your faith let it be done 
to you”;
	--Matthew 9:29
%
and their sight was restored. Jesus warned them sternly, “See that no one 
knows about this.”
	--Matthew 9:30
%
But they went out and spread the news about him all over that region.
	--Matthew 9:31
%
While they were going out, a man who was demon-possessed and could not talk was 
brought to Jesus.
	--Matthew 9:32
%
And when the demon was driven out, the man who had been mute spoke. The crowd 
was amazed and said, “Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel.”
	--Matthew 9:33
%
But the Pharisees said, “It is by the prince of demons that he drives out 
demons.”
	--Matthew 9:34
%
Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, 
proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness.
	--Matthew 9:35
%
When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed 
and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
	--Matthew 9:36
%
Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest is plentiful but the workers are 
few.
	--Matthew 9:37
%
Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest 
field.”
	--Matthew 9:38
%
Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out 
impure spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.
	--Matthew 10:1
%
These are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon (who is called Peter) 
and his brother Andrew; James son of Zebedee, and his brother John;
	--Matthew 10:2
%
Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James son of 
Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;
	--Matthew 10:3
%
Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.
	--Matthew 10:4
%
These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: “Do not go among 
the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans.
	--Matthew 10:5
%
Go rather to the lost sheep of Israel.
	--Matthew 10:6
%
As you go, proclaim this message: ‘The kingdom of heaven has come near.’
	--Matthew 10:7
%
Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, drive out 
demons. Freely you have received; freely give.
	--Matthew 10:8
%
“Do not get any gold or silver or copper to take with you in your belts—
	--Matthew 10:9
%
no bag for the journey or extra shirt or sandals or a staff, for the worker is 
worth his keep.
	--Matthew 10:10
%
Whatever town or village you enter, search there for some worthy person and 
stay at their house until you leave.
	--Matthew 10:11
%
As you enter the home, give it your greeting.
	--Matthew 10:12
%
If the home is deserving, let your peace rest on it; if it is not, let your 
peace return to you.
	--Matthew 10:13
%
If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, leave that home or town 
and shake the dust off your feet.
	--Matthew 10:14
%
Truly I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of 
judgment than for that town.
	--Matthew 10:15
%
“I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as 
snakes and as innocent as doves.
	--Matthew 10:16

Be on your guard; you will be handed over to the local councils and be flogged 
in the synagogues.
	--Matthew 10:17
%
On my account you will be brought before governors and kings as witnesses to 
them and to the Gentiles.
	--Matthew 10:18
%
But when they arrest you, do not worry about what to say or how to say it. At 
that time you will be given what to say,
	--Matthew 10:19
%
for it will not be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through 
you.
	--Matthew 10:20

“Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; children will 
rebel against their parents and have them put to death.

You will be hated by everyone because of me, but the one who stands firm to the 
end will be saved.

When you are persecuted in one place, flee to another. Truly I tell you, you

“The student is not above the teacher, nor a servant above his master.

members of his household!

After Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he went on from 
there to teach and preach in the towns of Galilee.
	--Matthew 11:1
%
When John, who was in prison, heard about the deeds of the Messiah, he sent his 
disciples
	--Matthew 11:2
%
to ask him, “Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone 
else?”
	--Matthew 11:3
%
Jesus replied, “Go back and report to John what you hear and see:
	--Matthew 11:4
%
The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cleansed, 
the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is proclaimed to the poor.
	--Matthew 11:5
%
Blessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of me.”
	--Matthew 11:6
%
As John’s disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about 
John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the 
wind?
	--Matthew 11:7
%
If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those 
who wear fine clothes are in kings’ palaces.
	--Matthew 11:8
%
Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a 
prophet.
	--Matthew 11:9
%
This is the one about whom it is written: “‘I will send my messenger ahead 
of you, who will prepare your way before you.’
	--Matthew 11:10
%
Truly I tell you, among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater 
than John the Baptist; yet whoever is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater 
than he.
	--Matthew 11:11
%
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been 
subjected to violence, and violent people have been raiding it.
	--Matthew 11:12
%
For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John.
	--Matthew 11:13
%
And if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who was to come.
	--Matthew 11:14
%
Whoever has ears, let them hear.
	--Matthew 11:15
%
“To what can I compare this generation? They are like children sitting in the 
marketplaces and calling out to others:
	--Matthew 11:16
%
“‘We played the pipe for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and 
you did not mourn.’
	--Matthew 11:17
%
For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon.’
	--Matthew 11:18
%
The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Here is a glutton and 
a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.’ But wisdom is proved 
right by her deeds.”
	--Matthew 11:19
%
Then Jesus began to denounce the towns in which most of his miracles had been 
performed, because they did not repent.
	--Matthew 11:20
%
“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were 
performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented 
long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
	--Matthew 11:21
%
But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of 
judgment than for you.
	--Matthew 11:22
%
And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted to the heavens? No, you will go down to 
Hades. For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in 
Sodom, it would have remained to this day.
	--Matthew 11:23
%
But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment 
than for you.”
	--Matthew 11:24
%
At that time Jesus said, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, 
because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed 
them to little children.
	--Matthew 11:25
%
Yes, Father, for this is what you were pleased to do.
	--Matthew 11:26
%
“All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows the Son 
except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom 
the Son chooses to reveal him.

“Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
	--Matthew 11:28
%
Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, 
and you will find rest for your souls.
	--Matthew 11:29
%
For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”
	--Matthew 11:30
%
At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples 
were hungry and began to pick some heads of grain and eat them.
	--Matthew 12:1
%
When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, “Look! Your disciples are 
doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath.”
	--Matthew 12:2
%
He answered, “Haven’t you read what David did when he and his companions 
were hungry?
	--Matthew 12:3
%
He entered the house of God, and he and his companions ate the consecrated 
bread—which was not lawful for them to do, but only for the priests.
	--Matthew 12:4
%
Or haven’t you read in the Law that the priests on Sabbath duty in the temple 
desecrate the Sabbath and yet are innocent?
	--Matthew 12:5
%
I tell you that something greater than the temple is here.
	--Matthew 12:6
%
If you had known what these words mean, ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice,’ 
you would not have condemned the innocent.
	--Matthew 12:7
%
For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”
	--Matthew 12:8
%
Going on from that place, he went into their synagogue,
	--Matthew 12:9
%
and a man with a shriveled hand was there. Looking for a reason to bring 
charges against Jesus, they asked him, “Is it lawful to heal on the 
Sabbath?”
	--Matthew 12:10
%
He said to them, “If any of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the 
Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?
	--Matthew 12:11
%
How much more valuable is a person than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do 
good on the Sabbath.”
	--Matthew 12:12
%
Then he said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” So he stretched it out 
and it was completely restored, just as sound as the other.
	--Matthew 12:13
%
But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus.
	--Matthew 12:14
%
Aware of this, Jesus withdrew from that place. A large crowd followed him, and 
he healed all who were ill.
	--Matthew 12:15
%
He warned them not to tell others about him.
	--Matthew 12:16
%
This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah:
	--Matthew 12:17
%
“Here is my servant whom I have chosen, the one I love, in whom I delight; I 
will put my Spirit on him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations.
	--Matthew 12:18
%
He will not quarrel or cry out; no one will hear his voice in the streets.
	--Matthew 12:19
%
A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out, 
till he has brought justice through to victory.
	--Matthew 12:20
%
    In his name the nations will put their hope.”
	--Matthew 12:21
%
Then they brought him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute, and Jesus 
healed him, so that he could both talk and see.
	--Matthew 12:22
%
All the people were astonished and said, “Could this be the Son of David?”
	--Matthew 12:23
%
But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, “It is only by Beelzebul, the 
prince of demons, that this fellow drives out demons.”
	--Matthew 12:24
%
Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, “Every kingdom divided against 
itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will 
not stand.
	--Matthew 12:25
%
If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then can his 
kingdom stand?
	--Matthew 12:26
%
And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your people drive them out? 
So then, they will be your judges.
	--Matthew 12:27
%
But if it is by the Spirit of God that I drive out demons, then the kingdom of 
God has come upon you.
	--Matthew 12:28
%
“Or again, how can anyone enter a strong man’s house and carry off his 
possessions unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can plunder his 
house.
	--Matthew 12:29
%
“Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me 
scatters.
	--Matthew 12:30
%
And so I tell you, every kind of sin and slander can be forgiven, but blasphemy 
against the Spirit will not be forgiven.
	--Matthew 12:31
%
Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone 
who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or 
in the age to come.
	--Matthew 12:32
%
“Make a tree good and its fruit will be good, or make a tree bad and its 
fruit will be bad, for a tree is recognized by its fruit.
	--Matthew 12:33
%
You brood of vipers, how can you who are evil say anything good? For the mouth 
speaks what the heart is full of.
	--Matthew 12:34
%
A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in him, and an evil man 
brings evil things out of the evil stored up in him.
	--Matthew 12:35
%
But I tell you that everyone will have to give account on the day of judgment 
for every empty word they have spoken.
	--Matthew 12:36
%
For by your words you will be acquitted, and by your words you will be 
condemned.”
	--Matthew 12:37
%
Then some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law said to him, “Teacher, we 
want to see a sign from you.”
	--Matthew 12:38
%
He answered, “A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a sign! But none 
will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.
	--Matthew 12:39
%
For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so 
the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
	--Matthew 12:40
%
The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and 
condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now something 
greater than Jonah is here.
	--Matthew 12:41
%
The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with this generation and 
condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon’s 
wisdom, and now something greater than Solomon is here.
	--Matthew 12:42
%
“When an impure spirit comes out of a person, it goes through arid places 
seeking rest and does not find it.
	--Matthew 12:43
%
Then it says, ‘I will return to the house I left.’ When it arrives, it 
finds the house unoccupied, swept clean and put in order.
	--Matthew 12:44
%
Then it goes and takes with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and 
they go in and live there. And the final condition of that person is worse than 
the first. That is how it will be with this wicked generation.”
	--Matthew 12:45
%
While Jesus was still talking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood 
outside, wanting to speak to him.
	--Matthew 12:46
%
Someone told him, “Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to 
speak to you.”
	--Matthew 12:47
%
He replied to him, “Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?”
	--Matthew 12:48
%
Pointing to his disciples, he said, “Here are my mother and my brothers.
	--Matthew 12:49
%
For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and 
mother.”
	--Matthew 12:50
%
That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the lake.
	--Matthew 13:1
%
Such large crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat in it, 
while all the people stood on the shore.
	--Matthew 13:2
%
Then he told them many things in parables, saying: “A farmer went out to sow 
his seed.
	--Matthew 13:3
%
As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and 
ate it up.
	--Matthew 13:4
%
Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up 
quickly, because the soil was shallow.
	--Matthew 13:5
%
But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because 
they had no root.
	--Matthew 13:6
%
Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants.
	--Matthew 13:7
%
Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop—a hundred, sixty 
or thirty times what was sown.
	--Matthew 13:8
%
Whoever has ears, let them hear.”
	--Matthew 13:9
%
The disciples came to him and asked, “Why do you speak to the people in 
parables?”
	--Matthew 13:10
%
He replied, “Because the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven 
has been given to you, but not to them.
	--Matthew 13:11
%
Whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does 
not have, even what they have will be taken from them.
	--Matthew 13:12
%
This is why I speak to them in parables: “Though seeing, they do not see; 
though hearing, they do not hear or understand.
	--Matthew 13:13
%
In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah: “‘You will be ever hearing but 
never understanding; you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.
	--Matthew 13:14
%
For this people’s heart has become calloused; they hardly hear with their 
ears, and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their 
eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts and turn, and I would 
heal them.’
	--Matthew 13:15
%
But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear.
	--Matthew 13:16
%
For truly I tell you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you 
see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.
	--Matthew 13:17
%
“Listen then to what the parable of the sower means:
	--Matthew 13:18
%
When anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it, the 
evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in their heart. This is the seed 
sown along the path.
	--Matthew 13:19
%
The seed falling on rocky ground refers to someone who hears the word and at 
once receives it with joy.
	--Matthew 13:20
%
But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or 
persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.
	--Matthew 13:21
%
The seed falling among the thorns refers to someone who hears the word, but the 
worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, making it 
unfruitful.
	--Matthew 13:22
%
But the seed falling on good soil refers to someone who hears the word and 
understands it. This is the one who produces a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty 
or thirty times what was sown.”
	--Matthew 13:23
%
Jesus told them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who 
sowed good seed in his field.
	--Matthew 13:24
%
But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the 
wheat, and went away.
	--Matthew 13:25
%
When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared.
	--Matthew 13:26
%
“The owner’s servants came to him and said, ‘Sir, didn’t you sow good 
seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?’
	--Matthew 13:27
%
“‘An enemy did this,’ he replied. “The servants asked him, ‘Do you 
want us to go and pull them up?’
	--Matthew 13:28
%
“‘No,’ he answered, ‘because while you are pulling the weeds, you may 
uproot the wheat with them.
	--Matthew 13:29
%
Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the 
harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then 
gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.’”
	--Matthew 13:30
%
He told them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, 
which a man took and planted in his field.
	--Matthew 13:31
%
Though it is the smallest of all seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of 
garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds come and perch in its 
branches.”
	--Matthew 13:32
%
He told them still another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that 
a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds of flour until it worked all 
through the dough.”
	--Matthew 13:33
%
Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd in parables; he did not say anything 
to them without using a parable.
	--Matthew 13:34
%
So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet: “I will open my mouth 
in parables, I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world.”
	--Matthew 13:35
%
Then he left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him and 
said, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.”
	--Matthew 13:36
%
He answered, “The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man.
	--Matthew 13:37
%
The field is the world, and the good seed stands for the people of the kingdom. 
The weeds are the people of the evil one,
	--Matthew 13:38
%
and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, 
and the harvesters are angels.
	--Matthew 13:39
%
“As the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end 
of the age.
	--Matthew 13:40
%
The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom 
everything that causes sin and all who do evil.
	--Matthew 13:41
%
They will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and 
gnashing of teeth.
	--Matthew 13:42
%
Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. 
Whoever has ears, let them hear.
	--Matthew 13:43
%
“The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found 
it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought 
that field.
	--Matthew 13:44
%
“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls.
	--Matthew 13:45
%
When he found one of great value, he went away and sold everything he had and 
bought it.
	--Matthew 13:46
%
“Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was let down into the 
lake and caught all kinds of fish.
	--Matthew 13:47
%
When it was full, the fishermen pulled it up on the shore. Then they sat down 
and collected the good fish in baskets, but threw the bad away.
	--Matthew 13:48
%
This is how it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate 
the wicked from the righteous
	--Matthew 13:49
%
and throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and 
gnashing of teeth.
	--Matthew 13:50
%
“Have you understood all these things?” Jesus asked. “Yes,” they 
replied.
	--Matthew 13:51
%
He said to them, “Therefore every teacher of the law who has become a 
disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out 
of his storeroom new treasures as well as old.”
	--Matthew 13:52
%
When Jesus had finished these parables, he moved on from there.
	--Matthew 13:53
%
Coming to his hometown, he began teaching the people in their synagogue, and 
they were amazed. “Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous 
powers?” they asked.
	--Matthew 13:54
%
“Isn’t this the carpenter’s son? Isn’t his mother’s name Mary, and 
aren’t his brothers James, Joseph, Simon and Judas?
	--Matthew 13:55
%
Aren’t all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these 
things?”
	--Matthew 13:56
%
And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not 
without honor except in his own town and in his own home.”
	--Matthew 13:57
%
And he did not do many miracles there because of their lack of faith.
	--Matthew 13:58
%
At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the reports about Jesus,
	--Matthew 14:1
%
and he said to his attendants, “This is John the Baptist; he has risen from 
the dead! That is why miraculous powers are at work in him.”
	--Matthew 14:2
%
Now Herod had arrested John and bound him and put him in prison because of 
Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife,
	--Matthew 14:3
%
for John had been saying to him: “It is not lawful for you to have her.”
	--Matthew 14:4
%
Herod wanted to kill John, but he was afraid of the people, because they 
considered John a prophet.
	--Matthew 14:5
%
On Herod’s birthday the daughter of Herodias danced for the guests and 
pleased Herod so much
	--Matthew 14:6
%
that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked.
	--Matthew 14:7
%
Prompted by her mother, she said, “Give me here on a platter the head of John 
the Baptist.”
	--Matthew 14:8
%
The king was distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he 
ordered that her request be granted
	--Matthew 14:9
%
and had John beheaded in the prison.
	--Matthew 14:10
%
His head was brought in on a platter and given to the girl, who carried it to 
her mother.
	--Matthew 14:11
%
John’s disciples came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and 
told Jesus.
	--Matthew 14:12
%
When Jesus heard what had happened, he withdrew by boat privately to a solitary 
place. Hearing of this, the crowds followed him on foot from the towns.
	--Matthew 14:13
%
When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them and healed 
their sick.
	--Matthew 14:14
%
As evening approached, the disciples came to him and said, “This is a remote 
place, and it’s already getting late. Send the crowds away, so they can go to 
the villages and buy themselves some food.”
	--Matthew 14:15
%
Jesus replied, “They do not need to go away. You give them something to 
eat.”
	--Matthew 14:16
%
“We have here only five loaves of bread and two fish,” they answered.
	--Matthew 14:17
%
“Bring them here to me,” he said.
	--Matthew 14:18
%
And he directed the people to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and 
the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. 
Then he gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.
	--Matthew 14:19
%
They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls 
of broken pieces that were left over.
	--Matthew 14:20
%
The number of those who ate was about five thousand men, besides women and 
children.
	--Matthew 14:21
%
Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him 
to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd.
	--Matthew 14:22
%
After he had dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. 
Later that night, he was there alone,
	--Matthew 14:23
%
and the boat was already a considerable distance from land, buffeted by the 
waves because the wind was against it.
	--Matthew 14:24
%
Shortly before dawn Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake.
	--Matthew 14:25
%
When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. “It’s 
a ghost,” they said, and cried out in fear.
	--Matthew 14:26
%
But Jesus immediately said to them: “Take courage! It is I. Don’t be 
afraid.”
	--Matthew 14:27
%
“Lord, if it’s you,” Peter replied, “tell me to come to you on the 
water.”
	--Matthew 14:28
%
“Come,” he said. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water 
and came toward Jesus.
	--Matthew 14:29
%
But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, 
“Lord, save me!”
	--Matthew 14:30
%
Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. “You of little 
faith,” he said, “why did you doubt?”
	--Matthew 14:31
%
And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down.
	--Matthew 14:32
%
Then those who were in the boat worshiped him, saying, “Truly you are the Son 
of God.”
	--Matthew 14:33
%
When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret.
	--Matthew 14:34
%
And when the men of that place recognized Jesus, they sent word to all the 
surrounding country. People brought all their sick to him
	--Matthew 14:35
%
and begged him to let the sick just touch the edge of his cloak, and all who 
touched it were healed.
	--Matthew 14:36
%
Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem and 
asked,
	--Matthew 15:1
%
“Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? They don’t wash 
their hands before they eat!”
	--Matthew 15:2
%
Jesus replied, “And why do you break the command of God for the sake of your 
tradition?
	--Matthew 15:3
%
For God said, ‘Honor your father and mother’ and ‘Anyone who curses their 
father or mother is to be put to death.’
	--Matthew 15:4
%
But you say that if anyone declares that what might have been used to help 
their father or mother is ‘devoted to God,’
	--Matthew 15:5
%
they are not to ‘honor their father or mother’ with it. Thus you nullify 
the word of God for the sake of your tradition.
	--Matthew 15:6
%
You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you:
	--Matthew 15:7
%
“‘These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.
	--Matthew 15:8
%
They worship me in vain; their teachings are merely human rules.’”
	--Matthew 15:9
%
Jesus called the crowd to him and said, “Listen and understand.
	--Matthew 15:10
%
What goes into someone’s mouth does not defile them, but what comes out of 
their mouth, that is what defiles them.”
	--Matthew 15:11
%
Then the disciples came to him and asked, “Do you know that the Pharisees 
were offended when they heard this?”
	--Matthew 15:12
%
He replied, “Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be 
pulled up by the roots.
	--Matthew 15:13
%
Leave them; they are blind guides. If the blind lead the blind, both will fall 
into a pit.”
	--Matthew 15:14
%
Peter said, “Explain the parable to us.”
	--Matthew 15:15
%
“Are you still so dull?” Jesus asked them.
	--Matthew 15:16
%
“Don’t you see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and 
then out of the body?
	--Matthew 15:17
%
But the things that come out of a person’s mouth come from the heart, and 
these defile them.
	--Matthew 15:18
%
For out of the heart come evil thoughts—murder, adultery, sexual immorality, 
theft, false testimony, slander.
	--Matthew 15:19
%
These are what defile a person; but eating with unwashed hands does not defile 
them.”
	--Matthew 15:20
%
Leaving that place, Jesus withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
	--Matthew 15:21
%
A Canaanite woman from that vicinity came to him, crying out, “Lord, Son of 
David, have mercy on me! My daughter is demon-possessed and suffering 
terribly.”
	--Matthew 15:22
%
Jesus did not answer a word. So his disciples came to him and urged him, 
“Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us.”
	--Matthew 15:23
%
He answered, “I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.”
	--Matthew 15:24
%
The woman came and knelt before him. “Lord, help me!” she said.
	--Matthew 15:25
%
He replied, “It is not right to take the children’s bread and toss it to 
the dogs.”
	--Matthew 15:26
%
“Yes it is, Lord,” she said. “Even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from 
their master’s table.”
	--Matthew 15:27
%
Then Jesus said to her, “Woman, you have great faith! Your request is 
granted.” And her daughter was healed at that moment.
	--Matthew 15:28
%
Jesus left there and went along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up on a 
mountainside and sat down.
	--Matthew 15:29
%
Great crowds came to him, bringing the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute 
and many others, and laid them at his feet; and he healed them.
	--Matthew 15:30
%
The people were amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled made well, 
the lame walking and the blind seeing. And they praised the God of Israel.
	--Matthew 15:31
%
Jesus called his disciples to him and said, “I have compassion for these 
people; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat. I do 
not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way.”
	--Matthew 15:32
%
His disciples answered, “Where could we get enough bread in this remote place 
to feed such a crowd?”
	--Matthew 15:33
%
“How many loaves do you have?” Jesus asked. “Seven,” they replied, 
“and a few small fish.”
	--Matthew 15:34
%
He told the crowd to sit down on the ground.
	--Matthew 15:35
%
Then he took the seven loaves and the fish, and when he had given thanks, he 
broke them and gave them to the disciples, and they in turn to the people.
	--Matthew 15:36
%
They all ate and were satisfied. Afterward the disciples picked up seven 
basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.
	--Matthew 15:37
%
The number of those who ate was four thousand men, besides women and children.
	--Matthew 15:38
%
After Jesus had sent the crowd away, he got into the boat and went to the 
vicinity of Magadan.
	--Matthew 15:39
%
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus and tested him by asking him to show 
them a sign from heaven.
	--Matthew 16:1
%
He replied, “When evening comes, you say, ‘It will be fair weather, for the 
sky is red,’
	--Matthew 16:2
%
and in the morning, ‘Today it will be stormy, for the sky is red and 
overcast.’ You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you 
cannot interpret the signs of the times.
	--Matthew 16:3
%
A wicked and adulterous generation looks for a sign, but none will be given it 
except the sign of Jonah.” Jesus then left them and went away.
	--Matthew 16:4
%
When they went across the lake, the disciples forgot to take bread.
	--Matthew 16:5
%
“Be careful,” Jesus said to them. “Be on your guard against the yeast of 
the Pharisees and Sadducees.”
	--Matthew 16:6
%
They discussed this among themselves and said, “It is because we didn’t 
bring any bread.”
	--Matthew 16:7
%
Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked, “You of little faith, why are you 
talking among yourselves about having no bread?
	--Matthew 16:8
%
Do you still not understand? Don’t you remember the five loaves for the five 
thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered?
	--Matthew 16:9
%
Or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered?
	--Matthew 16:10
%
How is it you don’t understand that I was not talking to you about bread? But 
be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”
	--Matthew 16:11
%
Then they understood that he was not telling them to guard against the yeast 
used in bread, but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
	--Matthew 16:12
%
When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, 
“Who do people say the Son of Man is?”
	--Matthew 16:13
%
They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still 
others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”
	--Matthew 16:14
%
“But what about you?” he asked. “Who do you say I am?”
	--Matthew 16:15
%
Simon Peter answered, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.”
	--Matthew 16:16
%
Jesus replied, “Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not 
revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven.
	--Matthew 16:17
%
And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and 
the gates of Hades will not overcome it.
	--Matthew 16:18
%
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth 
will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in 
heaven.”
	--Matthew 16:19
%
Then he ordered his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah.
	--Matthew 16:20
%
From that time on Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to 
Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, the chief priests 
and the teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and on the third day be 
raised to life.
	--Matthew 16:21
%
Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. “Never, Lord!” he said. 
“This shall never happen to you!”
	--Matthew 16:22
%
Jesus turned and said to Peter, “Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling 
block to me; you do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human 
concerns.”
	--Matthew 16:23
%
Then Jesus said to his disciples, “Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny 
themselves and take up their cross and follow me.
	--Matthew 16:24
%
For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life 
for me will find it.
	--Matthew 16:25
%
What good will it be for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their 
soul? Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?
	--Matthew 16:26
%
For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father’s glory with his angels, 
and then he will reward each person according to what they have done.
	--Matthew 16:27
%
“Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death before 
they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.”
	--Matthew 16:28
%
After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James and John the brother of James, 
and led them up a high mountain by themselves.
	--Matthew 17:1
%
There he was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his 
clothes became as white as the light.
	--Matthew 17:2
%
Just then there appeared before them Moses and Elijah, talking with Jesus.
	--Matthew 17:3
%
Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will 
put up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.”
	--Matthew 17:4
%
While he was still speaking, a bright cloud covered them, and a voice from the 
cloud said, “This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen 
to him!”
	--Matthew 17:5
%
When the disciples heard this, they fell facedown to the ground, terrified.
	--Matthew 17:6
%
But Jesus came and touched them. “Get up,” he said. “Don’t be afraid.”
	--Matthew 17:7
%
When they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus.
	--Matthew 17:8
%
As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus instructed them, “Don’t tell 
anyone what you have seen, until the Son of Man has been raised from the 
dead.”
	--Matthew 17:9
%
The disciples asked him, “Why then do the teachers of the law say that Elijah 
must come first?”
	--Matthew 17:10
%
Jesus replied, “To be sure, Elijah comes and will restore all things.
	--Matthew 17:11
%
But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but 
have done to him everything they wished. In the same way the Son of Man is 
going to suffer at their hands.”
	--Matthew 17:12
%
Then the disciples understood that he was talking to them about John the 
Baptist.
	--Matthew 17:13
%
When they came to the crowd, a man approached Jesus and knelt before him.
	--Matthew 17:14
%
“Lord, have mercy on my son,” he said. “He has seizures and is suffering 
greatly. He often falls into the fire or into the water.
	--Matthew 17:15
%
I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him.”
	--Matthew 17:16
%
“You unbelieving and perverse generation,” Jesus replied, “how long shall 
I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring the boy here to me.”
	--Matthew 17:17
%
Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of the boy, and he was healed at that 
moment.
	--Matthew 17:18
%
Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, “Why couldn’t we 
drive it out?”
	--Matthew 17:19
%
He replied, “Because you have so little faith. Truly I tell you, if you have 
faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, ‘Move from 
here to there,’ and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.”
	--Matthew 17:20
%

	--Matthew 17:21
%
When they came together in Galilee, he said to them, “The Son of Man is going 
to be delivered into the hands of men.
	--Matthew 17:22
%
They will kill him, and on the third day he will be raised to life.” And the 
disciples were filled with grief.
	--Matthew 17:23
%
After Jesus and his disciples arrived in Capernaum, the collectors of the 
two-drachma temple tax came to Peter and asked, “Doesn’t your teacher pay 
the temple tax?”
	--Matthew 17:24
%
“Yes, he does,” he replied. When Peter came into the house, Jesus was the 
first to speak. “What do you think, Simon?” he asked. “From whom do the 
kings of the earth collect duty and taxes—from their own children or from 
others?”
	--Matthew 17:25
%
“From others,” Peter answered. “Then the children are exempt,” Jesus 
said to him.
	--Matthew 17:26
%
“But so that we may not cause offense, go to the lake and throw out your 
line. Take the first fish you catch; open its mouth and you will find a 
four-drachma coin. Take it and give it to them for my tax and yours.”
	--Matthew 17:27
%
At that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Who, then, is the 
greatest in the kingdom of heaven?”
	--Matthew 18:1
%
He called a little child to him, and placed the child among them.
	--Matthew 18:2
%
And he said: “Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little 
children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.
	--Matthew 18:3
%
Therefore, whoever takes the lowly position of this child is the greatest in 
the kingdom of heaven.
	--Matthew 18:4
%
And whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me.
	--Matthew 18:5
%
“If anyone causes one of these little ones—those who believe in me—to 
stumble, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around 
their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.
	--Matthew 18:6
%
Woe to the world because of the things that cause people to stumble! Such 
things must come, but woe to the person through whom they come!
	--Matthew 18:7
%
If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. 
It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or 
two feet and be thrown into eternal fire.
	--Matthew 18:8
%
And if your eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is 
better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown 
into the fire of hell.
	--Matthew 18:9
%
“See that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I tell you that 
their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven.
	--Matthew 18:10
%

	--Matthew 18:11
%
“What do you think? If a man owns a hundred sheep, and one of them wanders 
away, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go to look for the one 
that wandered off?
	--Matthew 18:12
%
And if he finds it, truly I tell you, he is happier about that one sheep than 
about the ninety-nine that did not wander off.
	--Matthew 18:13
%
In the same way your Father in heaven is not willing that any of these little 
ones should perish.
	--Matthew 18:14
%
“If your brother or sister sins, go and point out their fault, just between 
the two of you. If they listen to you, you have won them over.
	--Matthew 18:15
%
But if they will not listen, take one or two others along, so that ‘every 
matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.’
	--Matthew 18:16
%
If they still refuse to listen, tell it to the church; and if they refuse to 
listen even to the church, treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
	--Matthew 18:17
%
“Truly I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and 
whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
	--Matthew 18:18
%
“Again, truly I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything 
they ask for, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.
	--Matthew 18:19
%
For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them.”
	--Matthew 18:20
%
Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, “Lord, how many times shall I forgive my 
brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?”
	--Matthew 18:21
%
Jesus answered, “I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times.
	--Matthew 18:22
%
“Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle 
accounts with his servants.
	--Matthew 18:23
%
As he began the settlement, a man who owed him ten thousand bags of gold was 
brought to him.
	--Matthew 18:24
%
Since he was not able to pay, the master ordered that he and his wife and his 
children and all that he had be sold to repay the debt.
	--Matthew 18:25
%
“At this the servant fell on his knees before him. ‘Be patient with me,’ 
he begged, ‘and I will pay back everything.’
	--Matthew 18:26
%
The servant’s master took pity on him, canceled the debt and let him go.
	--Matthew 18:27
%
“But when that servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed 
him a hundred silver coins. He grabbed him and began to choke him. ‘Pay back 
what you owe me!’ he demanded.
	--Matthew 18:28
%
“His fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him, ‘Be patient with me, 
and I will pay it back.’
	--Matthew 18:29
%
“But he refused. Instead, he went off and had the man thrown into prison 
until he could pay the debt.
	--Matthew 18:30
%
When the other servants saw what had happened, they were outraged and went and 
told their master everything that had happened.
	--Matthew 18:31
%
“Then the master called the servant in. ‘You wicked servant,’ he said, 
‘I canceled all that debt of yours because you begged me to.
	--Matthew 18:32
%
Shouldn’t you have had mercy on your fellow servant just as I had on you?’
	--Matthew 18:33
%
In anger his master handed him over to the jailers to be tortured, until he 
should pay back all he owed.
	--Matthew 18:34
%
“This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive 
your brother or sister from your heart.”
	--Matthew 18:35
%
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went into the 
region of Judea to the other side of the Jordan.
	--Matthew 19:1
%
Large crowds followed him, and he healed them there.
	--Matthew 19:2
%
Some Pharisees came to him to test him. They asked, “Is it lawful for a man 
to divorce his wife for any and every reason?”
	--Matthew 19:3
%
“Haven’t you read,” he replied, “that at the beginning the Creator 
‘made them male and female,’
	--Matthew 19:4
%
and said, ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be 
united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh’?
	--Matthew 19:5
%
So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined 
together, let no one separate.”
	--Matthew 19:6
%
“Why then,” they asked, “did Moses command that a man give his wife a 
certificate of divorce and send her away?”
	--Matthew 19:7
%
Jesus replied, “Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts 
were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning.
	--Matthew 19:8
%
I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and 
marries another woman commits adultery.”
	--Matthew 19:9
%
The disciples said to him, “If this is the situation between a husband and 
wife, it is better not to marry.”
	--Matthew 19:10
%
Jesus replied, “Not everyone can accept this word, but only those to whom it 
has been given.
	--Matthew 19:11
%
For there are eunuchs who were born that way, and there are eunuchs who have 
been made eunuchs by others—and there are those who choose to live like 
eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this 
should accept it.”
	--Matthew 19:12
%
Then people brought little children to Jesus for him to place his hands on them 
and pray for them. But the disciples rebuked them.
	--Matthew 19:13
%
Jesus said, “Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for 
the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.”
	--Matthew 19:14
%
When he had placed his hands on them, he went on from there.
	--Matthew 19:15
%
Just then a man came up to Jesus and asked, “Teacher, what good thing must I 
do to get eternal life?”
	--Matthew 19:16
%
“Why do you ask me about what is good?” Jesus replied. “There is only One 
who is good. If you want to enter life, keep the commandments.”
	--Matthew 19:17
%
“Which ones?” he inquired. Jesus replied, “‘You shall not murder, you 
shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not give false 
testimony,
	--Matthew 19:18
%
honor your father and mother,’ and ‘love your neighbor as yourself.’”
	--Matthew 19:19
%
“All these I have kept,” the young man said. “What do I still lack?”
	--Matthew 19:20
%
Jesus answered, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and 
give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.”
	--Matthew 19:21
%
When the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he had great wealth.
	--Matthew 19:22
%
Then Jesus said to his disciples, “Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone 
who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven.
	--Matthew 19:23
%
Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle 
than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.”
	--Matthew 19:24
%
When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, “Who 
then can be saved?”
	--Matthew 19:25
%
Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but with God all 
things are possible.”
	--Matthew 19:26
%
Peter answered him, “We have left everything to follow you! What then will 
there be for us?”
	--Matthew 19:27
%
Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, at the renewal of all things, when the 
Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit 
on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
	--Matthew 19:28
%
And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or 
wife or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and 
will inherit eternal life.
	--Matthew 19:29
%
But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.
	--Matthew 19:30
%
“For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the 
morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
	--Matthew 20:1
%
He agreed to pay them a denarius for the day and sent them into his vineyard.
	--Matthew 20:2
%
“About nine in the morning he went out and saw others standing in the 
marketplace doing nothing.
	--Matthew 20:3
%
He told them, ‘You also go and work in my vineyard, and I will pay you 
whatever is right.’
	--Matthew 20:4
%
So they went. “He went out again about noon and about three in the afternoon 
and did the same thing.
	--Matthew 20:5
%
About five in the afternoon he went out and found still others standing around. 
He asked them, ‘Why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing?’
	--Matthew 20:6
%
“‘Because no one has hired us,’ they answered. “He said to them, ‘You 
also go and work in my vineyard.’
	--Matthew 20:7
%
“When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, ‘Call 
the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last ones hired and 
going on to the first.’
	--Matthew 20:8
%
“The workers who were hired about five in the afternoon came and each 
received a denarius.
	--Matthew 20:9
%
So when those came who were hired first, they expected to receive more. But 
each one of them also received a denarius.
	--Matthew 20:10
%
When they received it, they began to grumble against the landowner.
	--Matthew 20:11
%
‘These who were hired last worked only one hour,’ they said, ‘and you 
have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the work and the heat 
of the day.’
	--Matthew 20:12
%
“But he answered one of them, ‘I am not being unfair to you, friend. 
Didn’t you agree to work for a denarius?

Take your pay and go. I want to give the one who was hired last the same as I 
gave you.

Don’t I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Or are you 
envious because I am generous?’

Now Jesus was going up to Jerusalem. On the way, he took the Twelve aside and 
said to them,
	--Matthew 20:17
%
“We are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered over to 
the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death
	--Matthew 20:18
%
and will hand him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified. 
On the third day he will be raised to life!”
	--Matthew 20:19
%
Then the mother of Zebedee’s sons came to Jesus with her sons and, kneeling 
down, asked a favor of him.
	--Matthew 20:20
%
“What is it you want?” he asked. She said, “Grant that one of these two 
sons of mine may sit at your right and the other at your left in your 
kingdom.”
	--Matthew 20:21
%
“You don’t know what you are asking,” Jesus said to them. “Can you 
drink the cup I am going to drink?” “We can,” they answered.
	--Matthew 20:22
%
Jesus said to them, “You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my 
right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom 
they have been prepared by my Father.”
	--Matthew 20:23
%
When the ten heard about this, they were indignant with the two brothers.
	--Matthew 20:24
%
Jesus called them together and said, “You know that the rulers of the 
Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over 
them.
	--Matthew 20:25
%
Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your 
servant,
	--Matthew 20:26
%
and whoever wants to be first must be your slave—
	--Matthew 20:27
%
just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his 
life as a ransom for many.”
	--Matthew 20:28
%
As Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed him.
	--Matthew 20:29
%
Two blind men were sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was 
going by, they shouted, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!”
	--Matthew 20:30
%
The crowd rebuked them and told them to be quiet, but they shouted all the 
louder, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!”
	--Matthew 20:31
%
Jesus stopped and called them. “What do you want me to do for you?” he 
asked.
	--Matthew 20:32
%
“Lord,” they answered, “we want our sight.”
	--Matthew 20:33
%
Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes. Immediately they received 
their sight and followed him.
	--Matthew 20:34
%
As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, 
Jesus sent two disciples,
	--Matthew 21:1
%
saying to them, “Go to the village ahead of you, and at once you will find a 
donkey tied there, with her colt by her. Untie them and bring them to me.
	--Matthew 21:2
%
If anyone says anything to you, say that the Lord needs them, and he will send 
them right away.”
	--Matthew 21:3
%
This took place to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet:
	--Matthew 21:4
%
“Say to Daughter Zion, ‘See, your king comes to you, gentle and riding on a 
donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a donkey.’”
	--Matthew 21:5
%
The disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them.
	--Matthew 21:6
%
They brought the donkey and the colt and placed their cloaks on them for Jesus 
to sit on.
	--Matthew 21:7
%
A very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road, while others cut branches 
from the trees and spread them on the road.
	--Matthew 21:8
%
The crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed shouted, “Hosanna 
to the Son of David!” “Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!” 
“Hosanna in the highest heaven!”
	--Matthew 21:9
%
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred and asked, “Who is 
this?”
	--Matthew 21:10
%
The crowds answered, “This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee.”
	--Matthew 21:11
%
Jesus entered the temple courts and drove out all who were buying and selling 
there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those 
selling doves.
	--Matthew 21:12
%
“It is written,” he said to them, “‘My house will be called a house of 
prayer,’ but you are making it ‘a den of robbers.’”
	--Matthew 21:13
%
The blind and the lame came to him at the temple, and he healed them.
	--Matthew 21:14
%
But when the chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things 
he did and the children shouting in the temple courts, “Hosanna to the Son of 
David,” they were indignant.
	--Matthew 21:15
%
“Do you hear what these children are saying?” they asked him. “Yes,” 
replied Jesus, “have you never read, “‘From the lips of children and 
infants you, Lord, have called forth your praise’?”
	--Matthew 21:16
%
And he left them and went out of the city to Bethany, where he spent the night.
	--Matthew 21:17
%
Early in the morning, as Jesus was on his way back to the city, he was hungry.
	--Matthew 21:18
%
Seeing a fig tree by the road, he went up to it but found nothing on it except 
leaves. Then he said to it, “May you never bear fruit again!” Immediately 
the tree withered.
	--Matthew 21:19
%
When the disciples saw this, they were amazed. “How did the fig tree wither 
so quickly?” they asked.
	--Matthew 21:20
%
Jesus replied, “Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not 
only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but also you can say to this 
mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and it will be done.
	--Matthew 21:21
%
If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer.”
	--Matthew 21:22
%
Jesus entered the temple courts, and, while he was teaching, the chief priests 
and the elders of the people came to him. “By what authority are you doing 
these things?” they asked. “And who gave you this authority?”
	--Matthew 21:23
%
Jesus replied, “I will also ask you one question. If you answer me, I will 
tell you by what authority I am doing these things.
	--Matthew 21:24
%
John’s baptism—where did it come from? Was it from heaven, or of human 
origin?” They discussed it among themselves and said, “If we say, ‘From 
heaven,’ he will ask, ‘Then why didn’t you believe him?’
	--Matthew 21:25
%
But if we say, ‘Of human origin’—we are afraid of the people, for they 
all hold that John was a prophet.”
	--Matthew 21:26
%
So they answered Jesus, “We don’t know.” Then he said, “Neither will I 
tell you by what authority I am doing these things.
	--Matthew 21:27
%
“What do you think? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first 
and said, ‘Son, go and work today in the vineyard.’
	--Matthew 21:28
%
“‘I will not,’ he answered, but later he changed his mind and went.
	--Matthew 21:29
%
“Then the father went to the other son and said the same thing. He answered, 
‘I will, sir,’ but he did not go.
	--Matthew 21:30
%
“Which of the two did what his father wanted?” “The first,” they 
answered. Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the 
prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you.
	--Matthew 21:31
%
For John came to you to show you the way of righteousness, and you did not 
believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did. And even after you 
saw this, you did not repent and believe him.

“Listen to another parable: There was a landowner who planted a vineyard. He 
put a wall around it, dug a winepress in it and built a watchtower. Then he 
rented the vineyard to some farmers and moved to another place.
	--Matthew 21:33
%
When the harvest time approached, he sent his servants to the tenants to 
collect his fruit.
	--Matthew 21:34
%
“The tenants seized his servants; they beat one, killed another, and stoned a 
third.
	--Matthew 21:35
%
Then he sent other servants to them, more than the first time, and the tenants 
treated them the same way.
	--Matthew 21:36
%
Last of all, he sent his son to them. ‘They will respect my son,’ he said.
	--Matthew 21:37
%
“But when the tenants saw the son, they said to each other, ‘This is the 
heir. Come, let’s kill him and take his inheritance.’
	--Matthew 21:38
%
So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.
	--Matthew 21:39
%
“Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those 
tenants?”
	--Matthew 21:40
%
“He will bring those wretches to a wretched end,” they replied, “and he 
will rent the vineyard to other tenants, who will give him his share of the 
crop at harvest time.”
	--Matthew 21:41
%
Jesus said to them, “Have you never read in the Scriptures: “‘The stone 
the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and 
it is marvelous in our eyes’?
	--Matthew 21:42
%
“Therefore I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and 
given to a people who will produce its fruit.
	--Matthew 21:43
%
Anyone who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; anyone on whom it 
falls will be crushed.”
	--Matthew 21:44
%
When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus’ parables, they knew he 
was talking about them.
	--Matthew 21:45
%
They looked for a way to arrest him, but they were afraid of the crowd because 
the people held that he was a prophet.
	--Matthew 21:46
%
Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying:
	--Matthew 22:1
%
“The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his 
son.
	--Matthew 22:2
%
He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the banquet to tell them 
to come, but they refused to come.
	--Matthew 22:3
%
“Then he sent some more servants and said, ‘Tell those who have been 
invited that I have prepared my dinner: My oxen and fattened cattle have been 
butchered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.’
	--Matthew 22:4
%
“But they paid no attention and went off—one to his field, another to his 
business.
	--Matthew 22:5
%
The rest seized his servants, mistreated them and killed them.
	--Matthew 22:6
%
The king was enraged. He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned 
their city.
	--Matthew 22:7
%
“Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding banquet is ready, but those I 
invited did not deserve to come.
	--Matthew 22:8
%
So go to the street corners and invite to the banquet anyone you find.’
	--Matthew 22:9
%
So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they 
could find, the bad as well as the good, and the wedding hall was filled with 
guests.
	--Matthew 22:10
%
“But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was 
not wearing wedding clothes.
	--Matthew 22:11
%
He asked, ‘How did you get in here without wedding clothes, friend?’ The 
man was speechless.
	--Matthew 22:12
%
“Then the king told the attendants, ‘Tie him hand and foot, and throw him 
outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of 
teeth.’
	--Matthew 22:13
%
“For many are invited, but few are chosen.”
	--Matthew 22:14
%
Then the Pharisees went out and laid plans to trap him in his words.
	--Matthew 22:15
%
They sent their disciples to him along with the Herodians. “Teacher,” they 
said, “we know that you are a man of integrity and that you teach the way of 
God in accordance with the truth. You aren’t swayed by others, because you 
pay no attention to who they are.
	--Matthew 22:16
%
Tell us then, what is your opinion? Is it right to pay the imperial tax to 
Caesar or not?”
	--Matthew 22:17
%
But Jesus, knowing their evil intent, said, “You hypocrites, why are you 
trying to trap me?
	--Matthew 22:18
%
Show me the coin used for paying the tax.” They brought him a denarius,
	--Matthew 22:19
%
and he asked them, “Whose image is this? And whose inscription?”
	--Matthew 22:20
%
“Caesar’s,” they replied. Then he said to them, “So give back to Caesar 
what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.”
	--Matthew 22:21
%
When they heard this, they were amazed. So they left him and went away.
	--Matthew 22:22
%
That same day the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with 
a question.
	--Matthew 22:23
%
“Teacher,” they said, “Moses told us that if a man dies without having 
children, his brother must marry the widow and raise up offspring for him.
	--Matthew 22:24
%
Now there were seven brothers among us. The first one married and died, and 
since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.
	--Matthew 22:25
%
The same thing happened to the second and third brother, right on down to the 
seventh.
	--Matthew 22:26
%
Finally, the woman died.
	--Matthew 22:27
%
Now then, at the resurrection, whose wife will she be of the seven, since all 
of them were married to her?”
	--Matthew 22:28
%
Jesus replied, “You are in error because you do not know the Scriptures or 
the power of God.
	--Matthew 22:29
%
At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they 
will be like the angels in heaven.
	--Matthew 22:30
%
But about the resurrection of the dead—have you not read what God said to you,
	--Matthew 22:31
%
‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? He is 
not the God of the dead but of the living.”
	--Matthew 22:32
%
When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at his teaching.
	--Matthew 22:33
%
Hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, the Pharisees got together.
	--Matthew 22:34
%
One of them, an expert in the law, tested him with this question:
	--Matthew 22:35
%
“Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?”
	--Matthew 22:36
%
Jesus replied: “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all 
your soul and with all your mind.’
	--Matthew 22:37
%
This is the first and greatest commandment.
	--Matthew 22:38
%
And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’
	--Matthew 22:39
%
All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.”
	--Matthew 22:40
%
While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,
	--Matthew 22:41
%
“What do you think about the Messiah? Whose son is he?” “The son of 
David,” they replied.
	--Matthew 22:42
%
He said to them, “How is it then that David, speaking by the Spirit, calls 
him ‘Lord’? For he says,
	--Matthew 22:43
%
“‘The Lord said to my Lord: “Sit at my right hand until I put your 
enemies under your feet.”’
	--Matthew 22:44
%
If then David calls him ‘Lord,’ how can he be his son?”
	--Matthew 22:45
%
No one could say a word in reply, and from that day on no one dared to ask him 
any more questions.
	--Matthew 22:46
%
Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples:
	--Matthew 23:1
%
“The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat.
	--Matthew 23:2
%
So you must be careful to do everything they tell you. But do not do what they 
do, for they do not practice what they preach.
	--Matthew 23:3
%
They tie up heavy, cumbersome loads and put them on other people’s shoulders, 
but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them.
	--Matthew 23:4
%
“Everything they do is done for people to see: They make their phylacteries 
wide and the tassels on their garments long;
	--Matthew 23:5
%
they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the 
synagogues;
	--Matthew 23:6
%
they love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to be called 
‘Rabbi’ by others.
	--Matthew 23:7
%
“But you are not to be called ‘Rabbi,’ for you have one Teacher, and you 
are all brothers.
	--Matthew 23:8
%
And do not call anyone on earth ‘father,’ for you have one Father, and he 
is in heaven.
	--Matthew 23:9
%
Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one Instructor, the Messiah.
	--Matthew 23:10
%
The greatest among you will be your servant.
	--Matthew 23:11
%
For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves 
will be exalted.
	--Matthew 23:12
%
“Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut the 
door of the kingdom of heaven in people’s faces. You yourselves do not enter,

“Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel 
over land and sea to win a single convert, and when you have succeeded, you 
make them twice as much a child of hell as you are.

“Woe to you, blind guides! You say, ‘If anyone swears by the temple, it 
means nothing; but anyone who swears by the gold of the temple is bound by that 
oath.’
	--Matthew 23:16

You blind fools! Which is greater: the gold, or the temple that makes the gold 
sacred?
	--Matthew 23:17
%
You also say, ‘If anyone swears by the altar, it means nothing; but anyone 
who swears by the gift on the altar is bound by that oath.’
	--Matthew 23:18
%
You blind men! Which is greater: the gift, or the altar that makes the gift 
sacred?
	--Matthew 23:19

Therefore, anyone who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it.

And anyone who swears by the temple swears by it and by the one who dwells in 
it.

sits on it.

“Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a 
tenth of your spices—mint, dill and cumin. But you have neglected the more

whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are

In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the 
inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.

“Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build 
tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous.

And you say, ‘If we had lived in the days of our ancestors, we would not have 
taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.’

So you testify against yourselves that you are the descendants of those who 
murdered the prophets.

other,

	--Matthew 24:32
%
Even so, when you see all these things, you know that it is near, right at the 
door.
	--Matthew 24:33
%
Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these 
things have happened.
	--Matthew 24:34
%
Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.
	--Matthew 24:35
%
“But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor 
the Son, but only the Father.
	--Matthew 24:36
%
As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.
	--Matthew 24:37
%
For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and 
giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark;
	--Matthew 24:38
%
and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took 
them all away. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.
	--Matthew 24:39
%
Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left.
	--Matthew 24:40
%
Two women will be grinding with a hand mill; one will be taken and the other 
left.
	--Matthew 24:41
%
“Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will 
come.
	--Matthew 24:42
%
But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what time of night 
the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have let his house 
be broken into.
	--Matthew 24:43
%
So you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you 
do not expect him.
	--Matthew 24:44
%
“Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom the master has put in charge 
of the servants in his household to give them their food at the proper time?
	--Matthew 24:45
%
It will be good for that servant whose master finds him doing so when he 
returns.
	--Matthew 24:46
%
Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions.
	--Matthew 24:47
%
But suppose that servant is wicked and says to himself, ‘My master is staying 
away a long time,’
	--Matthew 24:48
%
and he then begins to beat his fellow servants and to eat and drink with 
drunkards.
	--Matthew 24:49
%
The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and 
at an hour he is not aware of.
	--Matthew 24:50
%
He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites, where 
there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
	--Matthew 24:51
%
“At that time the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their 
lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
	--Matthew 25:1
%
Five of them were foolish and five were wise.
	--Matthew 25:2
%
The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take any oil with them.
	--Matthew 25:3
%
The wise ones, however, took oil in jars along with their lamps.
	--Matthew 25:4
%
The bridegroom was a long time in coming, and they all became drowsy and fell 
asleep.
	--Matthew 25:5
%
“At midnight the cry rang out: ‘Here’s the bridegroom! Come out to meet 
him!’
	--Matthew 25:6
%
“Then all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps.
	--Matthew 25:7
%
The foolish ones said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil; our lamps are 
going out.’
	--Matthew 25:8
%
“‘No,’ they replied, ‘there may not be enough for both us and you. 
Instead, go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.’
	--Matthew 25:9
%
“But while they were on their way to buy the oil, the bridegroom arrived. The 
virgins who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet. And the door 
was shut.
	--Matthew 25:10
%
“Later the others also came. ‘Lord, Lord,’ they said, ‘open the door 
for us!’
	--Matthew 25:11
%
“But he replied, ‘Truly I tell you, I don’t know you.’
	--Matthew 25:12
%
“Therefore keep watch, because you do not know the day or the hour.
	--Matthew 25:13
%
“Again, it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and 
entrusted his wealth to them.
	--Matthew 25:14
%
To one he gave five bags of gold, to another two bags, and to another one bag, 
each according to his ability. Then he went on his journey.
	--Matthew 25:15
%
The man who had received five bags of gold went at once and put his money to 
work and gained five bags more.
	--Matthew 25:16
%
So also, the one with two bags of gold gained two more.
	--Matthew 25:17
%
But the man who had received one bag went off, dug a hole in the ground and hid 
his master’s money.
	--Matthew 25:18
%
“After a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts 
with them.
	--Matthew 25:19
%
The man who had received five bags of gold brought the other five. 
‘Master,’ he said, ‘you entrusted me with five bags of gold. See, I have 
gained five more.’
	--Matthew 25:20
%
“His master replied, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been 
faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and 
share your master’s happiness!’
	--Matthew 25:21
%
“The man with two bags of gold also came. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘you 
entrusted me with two bags of gold; see, I have gained two more.’
	--Matthew 25:22
%
“His master replied, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been 
faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and 
share your master’s happiness!’
	--Matthew 25:23
%
“Then the man who had received one bag of gold came. ‘Master,’ he said, 
‘I knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown and 
gathering where you have not scattered seed.
	--Matthew 25:24
%
So I was afraid and went out and hid your gold in the ground. See, here is what 
belongs to you.’
	--Matthew 25:25
%
“His master replied, ‘You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest 
where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed?
	--Matthew 25:26
%
Well then, you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers, so that 
when I returned I would have received it back with interest.
	--Matthew 25:27
%
“‘So take the bag of gold from him and give it to the one who has ten bags.
	--Matthew 25:28
%
For whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever 
does not have, even what they have will be taken from them.
	--Matthew 25:29
%
And throw that worthless servant outside, into the darkness, where there will 
be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’
	--Matthew 25:30
%
“When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will 
sit on his glorious throne.
	--Matthew 25:31
%
All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people 
one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
	--Matthew 25:32
%
He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
	--Matthew 25:33
%
“Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed 
by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the 
creation of the world.
	--Matthew 25:34
%
For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave 
me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in,
	--Matthew 25:35
%
I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was 
in prison and you came to visit me.’
	--Matthew 25:36
%
“Then the righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and 
feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink?
	--Matthew 25:37
%
When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe 
you?
	--Matthew 25:38
%
When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?’
	--Matthew 25:39
%
“The King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the 
least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’
	--Matthew 25:40
%
“Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you who are 
cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.
	--Matthew 25:41
%
For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me 
nothing to drink,
	--Matthew 25:42
%
I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not 
clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.’
	--Matthew 25:43
%
“They also will answer, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a 
stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?’
	--Matthew 25:44
%
“He will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the 
least of these, you did not do for me.’
	--Matthew 25:45
%
“Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal 
life.”
	--Matthew 25:46
%
When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he said to his disciples,
	--Matthew 26:1
%
“As you know, the Passover is two days away—and the Son of Man will be 
handed over to be crucified.”
	--Matthew 26:2
%
Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of 
the high priest, whose name was Caiaphas,
	--Matthew 26:3
%
and they schemed to arrest Jesus secretly and kill him.
	--Matthew 26:4
%
“But not during the festival,” they said, “or there may be a riot among 
the people.”
	--Matthew 26:5
%
While Jesus was in Bethany in the home of Simon the Leper,
	--Matthew 26:6
%
a woman came to him with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, which she 
poured on his head as he was reclining at the table.
	--Matthew 26:7
%
When the disciples saw this, they were indignant. “Why this waste?” they 
asked.
	--Matthew 26:8
%
“This perfume could have been sold at a high price and the money given to the 
poor.”
	--Matthew 26:9
%
Aware of this, Jesus said to them, “Why are you bothering this woman? She has 
done a beautiful thing to me.
	--Matthew 26:10
%
The poor you will always have with you, but you will not always have me.
	--Matthew 26:11
%
When she poured this perfume on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.
	--Matthew 26:12
%
Truly I tell you, wherever this gospel is preached throughout the world, what 
she has done will also be told, in memory of her.”
	--Matthew 26:13
%
Then one of the Twelve—the one called Judas Iscariot—went to the chief 
priests
	--Matthew 26:14
%
and asked, “What are you willing to give me if I deliver him over to you?” 
So they counted out for him thirty pieces of silver.
	--Matthew 26:15
%
From then on Judas watched for an opportunity to hand him over.
	--Matthew 26:16
%
On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to 
Jesus and asked, “Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat 
the Passover?”
	--Matthew 26:17
%
He replied, “Go into the city to a certain man and tell him, ‘The Teacher 
says: My appointed time is near. I am going to celebrate the Passover with my 
disciples at your house.’”
	--Matthew 26:18
%
So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover.
	--Matthew 26:19
%
When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the Twelve.
	--Matthew 26:20
%
And while they were eating, he said, “Truly I tell you, one of you will 
betray me.”
	--Matthew 26:21
%
They were very sad and began to say to him one after the other, “Surely you 
don’t mean me, Lord?”
	--Matthew 26:22
%
Jesus replied, “The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will 
betray me.
	--Matthew 26:23
%
The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who 
betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.”
	--Matthew 26:24
%
Then Judas, the one who would betray him, said, “Surely you don’t mean me, 
Rabbi?” Jesus answered, “You have said so.”
	--Matthew 26:25
%
While they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, he 
broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, “Take and eat; this is my 
body.”
	--Matthew 26:26
%
Then he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, 
“Drink from it, all of you.
	--Matthew 26:27
%
This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the 
forgiveness of sins.
	--Matthew 26:28
%
I tell you, I will not drink from this fruit of the vine from now on until that 
day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.”
	--Matthew 26:29
%
When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
	--Matthew 26:30
%
Then Jesus told them, “This very night you will all fall away on account of 
me, for it is written: “‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the 
flock will be scattered.’
	--Matthew 26:31
%
But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.”
	--Matthew 26:32
%
Peter replied, “Even if all fall away on account of you, I never will.”
	--Matthew 26:33
%
“Truly I tell you,” Jesus answered, “this very night, before the rooster 
crows, you will disown me three times.”
	--Matthew 26:34
%
But Peter declared, “Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown 
you.” And all the other disciples said the same.
	--Matthew 26:35
%
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to 
them, “Sit here while I go over there and pray.”
	--Matthew 26:36
%
He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him, and he began to be 
sorrowful and troubled.
	--Matthew 26:37
%
Then he said to them, “My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of 
death. Stay here and keep watch with me.”
	--Matthew 26:38
%
Going a little farther, he fell with his face to the ground and prayed, “My 
Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, 
but as you will.”
	--Matthew 26:39
%
Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. “Couldn’t you 
men keep watch with me for one hour?” he asked Peter.
	--Matthew 26:40
%
“Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is 
willing, but the flesh is weak.”
	--Matthew 26:41
%
He went away a second time and prayed, “My Father, if it is not possible for 
this cup to be taken away unless I drink it, may your will be done.”
	--Matthew 26:42
%
When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy.
	--Matthew 26:43
%
So he left them and went away once more and prayed the third time, saying the 
same thing.
	--Matthew 26:44
%
Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, “Are you still sleeping 
and resting? Look, the hour has come, and the Son of Man is delivered into the 
hands of sinners.
	--Matthew 26:45
%
Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!”
	--Matthew 26:46
%
While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. With him was a 
large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the 
elders of the people.
	--Matthew 26:47
%
Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: “The one I kiss is the man; 
arrest him.”
	--Matthew 26:48
%
Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, “Greetings, Rabbi!” and kissed him.
	--Matthew 26:49
%
Jesus replied, “Do what you came for, friend.” Then the men stepped 
forward, seized Jesus and arrested him.
	--Matthew 26:50
%
With that, one of Jesus’ companions reached for his sword, drew it out and 
struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
	--Matthew 26:51
%
“Put your sword back in its place,” Jesus said to him, “for all who draw 
the sword will die by the sword.
	--Matthew 26:52
%
Do you think I cannot call on my Father, and he will at once put at my disposal 
more than twelve legions of angels?
	--Matthew 26:53
%
But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen in this 
way?”
	--Matthew 26:54
%
In that hour Jesus said to the crowd, “Am I leading a rebellion, that you 
have come out with swords and clubs to capture me? Every day I sat in the 
temple courts teaching, and you did not arrest me.
	--Matthew 26:55
%
But this has all taken place that the writings of the prophets might be 
fulfilled.” Then all the disciples deserted him and fled.
	--Matthew 26:56
%
Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the 
teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.
	--Matthew 26:57
%
But Peter followed him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high 
priest. He entered and sat down with the guards to see the outcome.
	--Matthew 26:58
%
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence 
against Jesus so that they could put him to death.
	--Matthew 26:59
%
But they did not find any, though many false witnesses came forward. Finally 
two came forward
	--Matthew 26:60
%
and declared, “This fellow said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God 
and rebuild it in three days.’”
	--Matthew 26:61
%
Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, “Are you not going to 
answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?”
	--Matthew 26:62
%
But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, “I charge you under 
oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God.”
	--Matthew 26:63
%
“You have said so,” Jesus replied. “But I say to all of you: From now on 
you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and 
coming on the clouds of heaven.”
	--Matthew 26:64
%
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, “He has spoken blasphemy! Why 
do we need any more witnesses? Look, now you have heard the blasphemy.
	--Matthew 26:65
%
What do you think?” “He is worthy of death,” they answered.
	--Matthew 26:66
%
Then they spit in his face and struck him with their fists. Others slapped him
	--Matthew 26:67
%
and said, “Prophesy to us, Messiah. Who hit you?”
	--Matthew 26:68
%
Now Peter was sitting out in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him. 
“You also were with Jesus of Galilee,” she said.
	--Matthew 26:69
%
But he denied it before them all. “I don’t know what you’re talking 
about,” he said.
	--Matthew 26:70
%
Then he went out to the gateway, where another servant girl saw him and said to 
the people there, “This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth.”
	--Matthew 26:71
%
He denied it again, with an oath: “I don’t know the man!”
	--Matthew 26:72
%
After a little while, those standing there went up to Peter and said, “Surely 
you are one of them; your accent gives you away.”
	--Matthew 26:73
%
Then he began to call down curses, and he swore to them, “I don’t know the 
man!” Immediately a rooster crowed.
	--Matthew 26:74
%
Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken: “Before the rooster crows, 
you will disown me three times.” And he went outside and wept bitterly.
	--Matthew 26:75
%
Early in the morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people made 
their plans how to have Jesus executed.
	--Matthew 27:1
%
So they bound him, led him away and handed him over to Pilate the governor.
	--Matthew 27:2
%
When Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he was seized 
with remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and 
the elders.
	--Matthew 27:3
%
“I have sinned,” he said, “for I have betrayed innocent blood.” “What 
is that to us?” they replied. “That’s your responsibility.”
	--Matthew 27:4
%
So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged 
himself.
	--Matthew 27:5
%
The chief priests picked up the coins and said, “It is against the law to put 
this into the treasury, since it is blood money.”
	--Matthew 27:6
%
So they decided to use the money to buy the potter’s field as a burial place 
for foreigners.
	--Matthew 27:7
%
That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day.
	--Matthew 27:8
%
Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: “They took the 
thirty pieces of silver, the price set on him by the people of Israel,
	--Matthew 27:9
%
and they used them to buy the potter’s field, as the Lord commanded me.”
	--Matthew 27:10
%
Meanwhile Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, “Are 
you the king of the Jews?” “You have said so,” Jesus replied.
	--Matthew 27:11
%
When he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he gave no answer.
	--Matthew 27:12
%
Then Pilate asked him, “Don’t you hear the testimony they are bringing 
against you?”
	--Matthew 27:13
%
But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge—to the great amazement 
of the governor.
	--Matthew 27:14
%
Now it was the governor’s custom at the festival to release a prisoner chosen 
by the crowd.
	--Matthew 27:15
%
At that time they had a well-known prisoner whose name was Jesus Barabbas.
	--Matthew 27:16
%
So when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, “Which one do you want me 
to release to you: Jesus Barabbas, or Jesus who is called the Messiah?”
	--Matthew 27:17
%
For he knew it was out of self-interest that they had handed Jesus over to him.
	--Matthew 27:18
%
While Pilate was sitting on the judge’s seat, his wife sent him this message: 
“Don’t have anything to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered a 
great deal today in a dream because of him.”
	--Matthew 27:19
%
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas 
and to have Jesus executed.
	--Matthew 27:20
%
“Which of the two do you want me to release to you?” asked the governor. 
“Barabbas,” they answered.
	--Matthew 27:21
%
“What shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called the Messiah?” Pilate 
asked. They all answered, “Crucify him!”
	--Matthew 27:22
%
“Why? What crime has he committed?” asked Pilate. But they shouted all the 
louder, “Crucify him!”
	--Matthew 27:23
%
When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was 
starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. “I am 
innocent of this man’s blood,” he said. “It is your responsibility!”
	--Matthew 27:24
%
All the people answered, “His blood is on us and on our children!”
	--Matthew 27:25
%
Then he released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and handed him 
over to be crucified.
	--Matthew 27:26
%
Then the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the 
whole company of soldiers around him.
	--Matthew 27:27
%
They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him,
	--Matthew 27:28
%
and then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head. They put a 
staff in his right hand. Then they knelt in front of him and mocked him. 
“Hail, king of the Jews!” they said.
	--Matthew 27:29
%
They spit on him, and took the staff and struck him on the head again and again.
	--Matthew 27:30
%
After they had mocked him, they took off the robe and put his own clothes on 
him. Then they led him away to crucify him.
	--Matthew 27:31
%
As they were going out, they met a man from Cyrene, named Simon, and they 
forced him to carry the cross.
	--Matthew 27:32
%
They came to a place called Golgotha (which means “the place of the skull”).
	--Matthew 27:33
%
There they offered Jesus wine to drink, mixed with gall; but after tasting it, 
he refused to drink it.
	--Matthew 27:34
%
When they had crucified him, they divided up his clothes by casting lots.
	--Matthew 27:35
%
And sitting down, they kept watch over him there.
	--Matthew 27:36
%
Above his head they placed the written charge against him: this is jesus, the 
king of the jews.
	--Matthew 27:37
%
Two rebels were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.
	--Matthew 27:38
%
Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads
	--Matthew 27:39
%
and saying, “You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three 
days, save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!”
	--Matthew 27:40
%
In the same way the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders 
mocked him.
	--Matthew 27:41
%
“He saved others,” they said, “but he can’t save himself! He’s the 
king of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in 
him.
	--Matthew 27:42
%
He trusts in God. Let God rescue him now if he wants him, for he said, ‘I am 
the Son of God.’”
	--Matthew 27:43
%
In the same way the rebels who were crucified with him also heaped insults on 
him.
	--Matthew 27:44
%
From noon until three in the afternoon darkness came over all the land.
	--Matthew 27:45
%
About three in the afternoon Jesus cried out in a loud voice, “Eli, Eli, lema 
sabachthani?” (which means “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”).
	--Matthew 27:46
%
When some of those standing there heard this, they said, “He’s calling 
Elijah.”
	--Matthew 27:47
%
Immediately one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar, 
put it on a staff, and offered it to Jesus to drink.
	--Matthew 27:48
%
The rest said, “Now leave him alone. Let’s see if Elijah comes to save 
him.”
	--Matthew 27:49
%
And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit.
	--Matthew 27:50
%
At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. 
The earth shook, the rocks split
	--Matthew 27:51
%
and the tombs broke open. The bodies of many holy people who had died were 
raised to life.
	--Matthew 27:52
%
They came out of the tombs after Jesus’ resurrection and went into the holy 
city and appeared to many people.
	--Matthew 27:53
%
When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the 
earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified, and exclaimed, 
“Surely he was the Son of God!”
	--Matthew 27:54
%
Many women were there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from 
Galilee to care for his needs.
	--Matthew 27:55
%
Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the 
mother of Zebedee’s sons.
	--Matthew 27:56
%
As evening approached, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who 
had himself become a disciple of Jesus.
	--Matthew 27:57
%
Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus’ body, and Pilate ordered that it be 
given to him.
	--Matthew 27:58
%
Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
	--Matthew 27:59
%
and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock. He rolled a 
big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away.
	--Matthew 27:60
%
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb.
	--Matthew 27:61
%
The next day, the one after Preparation Day, the chief priests and the 
Pharisees went to Pilate.
	--Matthew 27:62
%
“Sir,” they said, “we remember that while he was still alive that 
deceiver said, ‘After three days I will rise again.’
	--Matthew 27:63
%
So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day. 
Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that 
he has been raised from the dead. This last deception will be worse than the 
first.”
	--Matthew 27:64
%
“Take a guard,” Pilate answered. “Go, make the tomb as secure as you know 
how.”
	--Matthew 27:65
%
So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and 
posting the guard.
	--Matthew 27:66
%
After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the 
other Mary went to look at the tomb.
	--Matthew 28:1
%
There was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven 
and, going to the tomb, rolled back the stone and sat on it.
	--Matthew 28:2
%
His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow.
	--Matthew 28:3
%
The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men.
	--Matthew 28:4
%
The angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you are 
looking for Jesus, who was crucified.
	--Matthew 28:5
%
He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he 
lay.
	--Matthew 28:6
%
Then go quickly and tell his disciples: ‘He has risen from the dead and is 
going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.’ Now I have told 
you.”
	--Matthew 28:7
%
So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to 
tell his disciples.
	--Matthew 28:8
%
Suddenly Jesus met them. “Greetings,” he said. They came to him, clasped 
his feet and worshiped him.
	--Matthew 28:9
%
Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to 
Galilee; there they will see me.”
	--Matthew 28:10
%
While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and 
reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
	--Matthew 28:11
%
When the chief priests had met with the elders and devised a plan, they gave 
the soldiers a large sum of money,
	--Matthew 28:12
%
telling them, “You are to say, ‘His disciples came during the night and 
stole him away while we were asleep.’
	--Matthew 28:13
%
If this report gets to the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of 
trouble.”
	--Matthew 28:14
%
So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. And this story 
has been widely circulated among the Jews to this very day.
	--Matthew 28:15
%
Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told 
them to go.
	--Matthew 28:16
%
When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted.
	--Matthew 28:17
%
Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has 
been given to me.
	--Matthew 28:18
%
Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of 
the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
	--Matthew 28:19
%
and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with 
you always, to the very end of the age.”
	--Matthew 28:20
%
Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our dear 
friend and fellow worker—
	--Philemon 1:1
%
also to Apphia our sister and Archippus our fellow soldier—and to the church 
that meets in your home:
	--Philemon 1:2
%
Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
	--Philemon 1:3
%
I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers,
	--Philemon 1:4
%
because I hear about your love for all his holy people and your faith in the 
Lord Jesus.
	--Philemon 1:5
%
I pray that your partnership with us in the faith may be effective in deepening 
your understanding of every good thing we share for the sake of Christ.
	--Philemon 1:6
%
Your love has given me great joy and encouragement, because you, brother, have 
refreshed the hearts of the Lord’s people.
	--Philemon 1:7
%
Therefore, although in Christ I could be bold and order you to do what you 
ought to do,
	--Philemon 1:8
%
yet I prefer to appeal to you on the basis of love. It is as none other than 
Paul—an old man and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus—
	--Philemon 1:9
%
that I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, who became my son while I was in 
chains.
	--Philemon 1:10
%
Formerly he was useless to you, but now he has become useful both to you and to 
me.
	--Philemon 1:11
%
I am sending him—who is my very heart—back to you.
	--Philemon 1:12
%
I would have liked to keep him with me so that he could take your place in 
helping me while I am in chains for the gospel.
	--Philemon 1:13
%
But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that any favor you 
do would not seem forced but would be voluntary.
	--Philemon 1:14
%
Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that you 
might have him back forever—
	--Philemon 1:15
%
no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a dear brother. He is very 
dear to me but even dearer to you, both as a fellow man and as a brother in the 
Lord.
	--Philemon 1:16
%
So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me.
	--Philemon 1:17
%
If he has done you any wrong or owes you anything, charge it to me.
	--Philemon 1:18
%
I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand. I will pay it back—not to mention 
that you owe me your very self.
	--Philemon 1:19
%
I do wish, brother, that I may have some benefit from you in the Lord; refresh 
my heart in Christ.
	--Philemon 1:20
%
Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more 
than I ask.
	--Philemon 1:21
%
And one thing more: Prepare a guest room for me, because I hope to be restored 
to you in answer to your prayers.
	--Philemon 1:22
%
Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings.
	--Philemon 1:23
%
And so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my fellow workers.
	--Philemon 1:24
%
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
	--Philemon 1:25
%
Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, To all God’s holy people in 
Christ Jesus at Philippi, together with the overseers and deacons:
	 --Philippians 1:1
%
Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
	 --Philippians 1:2
%
I thank my God every time I remember you.
	 --Philippians 1:3
%
In all my prayers for all of you, I always pray with joy
	 --Philippians 1:4
%
because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now,
	 --Philippians 1:5
%
being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on 
to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.
	 --Philippians 1:6
%
It is right for me to feel this way about all of you, since I have you in my 
heart and, whether I am in chains or defending and confirming the gospel, all 
of you share in God’s grace with me.
	 --Philippians 1:7
%
God can testify how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus.
	 --Philippians 1:8
%
And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and 
depth of insight,
	 --Philippians 1:9
%
so that you may be able to discern what is best and may be pure and blameless 
for the day of Christ,
	 --Philippians 1:10
%
filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ—to the 
glory and praise of God.
	 --Philippians 1:11
%
Now I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that what has happened to me has 
actually served to advance the gospel.
	 --Philippians 1:12
%
As a result, it has become clear throughout the whole palace guard and to 
everyone else that I am in chains for Christ.
	 --Philippians 1:13
%
And because of my chains, most of the brothers and sisters have become 
confident in the Lord and dare all the more to proclaim the gospel without fear.
	 --Philippians 1:14
%
It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of 
goodwill.
	 --Philippians 1:15
%
The latter do so out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the 
gospel.
	 --Philippians 1:16
%
The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing that 
they can stir up trouble for me while I am in chains.
	 --Philippians 1:17
%
But what does it matter? The important thing is that in every way, whether from 
false motives or true, Christ is preached. And because of this I rejoice. Yes, 
and I will continue to rejoice,
	 --Philippians 1:18
%
for I know that through your prayers and God’s provision of the Spirit of 
Jesus Christ what has happened to me will turn out for my deliverance.
	 --Philippians 1:19
%
I eagerly expect and hope that I will in no way be ashamed, but will have 
sufficient courage so that now as always Christ will be exalted in my body, 
whether by life or by death.
	 --Philippians 1:20
%
For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.
	 --Philippians 1:21
%
If I am to go on living in the body, this will mean fruitful labor for me. Yet 
what shall I choose? I do not know!
	 --Philippians 1:22
%
I am torn between the two: I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is 
better by far;
	 --Philippians 1:23
%
but it is more necessary for you that I remain in the body.
	 --Philippians 1:24
%
Convinced of this, I know that I will remain, and I will continue with all of 
you for your progress and joy in the faith,
	 --Philippians 1:25
%
so that through my being with you again your boasting in Christ Jesus will 
abound on account of me.
	 --Philippians 1:26
%
Whatever happens, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of 
Christ. Then, whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence, 
I will know that you stand firm in the one Spirit, striving together as one for 
the faith of the gospel
	 --Philippians 1:27
%
without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you. This is a sign to 
them that they will be destroyed, but that you will be saved—and that by God.
	 --Philippians 1:28
%
For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe in him, 
but also to suffer for him,
	 --Philippians 1:29
%
since you are going through the same struggle you saw I had, and now hear that 
I still have.
	 --Philippians 1:30
%
Therefore if you have any encouragement from being united with Christ, if any 
comfort from his love, if any common sharing in the Spirit, if any tenderness 
and compassion,
	 --Philippians 2:1
%
then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being one 
in spirit and of one mind.
	 --Philippians 2:2
%
Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value 
others above yourselves,
	 --Philippians 2:3
%
not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the 
others.
	 --Philippians 2:4
%
In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus:
	 --Philippians 2:5
%
Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to 
be used to his own advantage;
	 --Philippians 2:6
%
rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being 
made in human likeness.
	 --Philippians 2:7
%
And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient 
to death— even death on a cross!
	 --Philippians 2:8
%
Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is 
above every name,
	 --Philippians 2:9
%
that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and 
under the earth,
	 --Philippians 2:10
%
and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the 
Father.
	 --Philippians 2:11
%
Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always obeyed—not only in my 
presence, but now much more in my absence—continue to work out your salvation 
with fear and trembling,
	 --Philippians 2:12
%
for it is God who works in you to will and to act in order to fulfill his good 
purpose.
	 --Philippians 2:13
%
Do everything without grumbling or arguing,
	 --Philippians 2:14
%
so that you may become blameless and pure, “children of God without fault in 
a warped and crooked generation.” Then you will shine among them like stars 
in the sky
	 --Philippians 2:15
%
as you hold firmly to the word of life. And then I will be able to boast on the 
day of Christ that I did not run or labor in vain.
	 --Philippians 2:16
%
But even if I am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and 
service coming from your faith, I am glad and rejoice with all of you.
	 --Philippians 2:17
%
So you too should be glad and rejoice with me.
	 --Philippians 2:18
%
I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be 
cheered when I receive news about you.
	 --Philippians 2:19
%
I have no one else like him, who will show genuine concern for your welfare.
	 --Philippians 2:20
%
For everyone looks out for their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ.
	 --Philippians 2:21
%
But you know that Timothy has proved himself, because as a son with his father 
he has served with me in the work of the gospel.
	 --Philippians 2:22
%
I hope, therefore, to send him as soon as I see how things go with me.
	 --Philippians 2:23
%
And I am confident in the Lord that I myself will come soon.
	 --Philippians 2:24
%
But I think it is necessary to send back to you Epaphroditus, my brother, 
co-worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger, whom you sent to take 
care of my needs.
	 --Philippians 2:25
%
For he longs for all of you and is distressed because you heard he was ill.
	 --Philippians 2:26
%
Indeed he was ill, and almost died. But God had mercy on him, and not on him 
only but also on me, to spare me sorrow upon sorrow.
	 --Philippians 2:27
%
Therefore I am all the more eager to send him, so that when you see him again 
you may be glad and I may have less anxiety.
	 --Philippians 2:28
%
So then, welcome him in the Lord with great joy, and honor people like him,
	 --Philippians 2:29
%
because he almost died for the work of Christ. He risked his life to make up 
for the help you yourselves could not give me.
	 --Philippians 2:30
%
Further, my brothers and sisters, rejoice in the Lord! It is no trouble for me 
to write the same things to you again, and it is a safeguard for you.
	 --Philippians 3:1
%
Watch out for those dogs, those evildoers, those mutilators of the flesh.
	 --Philippians 3:2
%
For it is we who are the circumcision, we who serve God by his Spirit, who 
boast in Christ Jesus, and who put no confidence in the flesh—
	 --Philippians 3:3
%
though I myself have reasons for such confidence. If someone else thinks they 
have reasons to put confidence in the flesh, I have more:
	 --Philippians 3:4
%
circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of 
Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; in regard to the law, a Pharisee;
	 --Philippians 3:5
%
as for zeal, persecuting the church; as for righteousness based on the law, 
faultless.
	 --Philippians 3:6
%
But whatever were gains to me I now consider loss for the sake of Christ.
	 --Philippians 3:7
%
What is more, I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of 
knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider 
them garbage, that I may gain Christ
	 --Philippians 3:8
%
and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the 
law, but that which is through faith in Christ—the righteousness that comes 
from God on the basis of faith.
	 --Philippians 3:9
%
I want to know Christ—yes, to know the power of his resurrection and 
participation in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death,
	 --Philippians 3:10
%
and so, somehow, attaining to the resurrection from the dead.
	 --Philippians 3:11
%
Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already arrived at my goal, 
but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.
	 --Philippians 3:12
%
Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. 
But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is 
ahead,
	 --Philippians 3:13
%
I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me 
heavenward in Christ Jesus.
	 --Philippians 3:14
%
All of us, then, who are mature should take such a view of things. And if on 
some point you think differently, that too God will make clear to you.
	 --Philippians 3:15
%
Only let us live up to what we have already attained.
	 --Philippians 3:16
%
Join together in following my example, brothers and sisters, and just as you 
have us as a model, keep your eyes on those who live as we do.
	 --Philippians 3:17
%
For, as I have often told you before and now tell you again even with tears, 
many live as enemies of the cross of Christ.
	 --Philippians 3:18
%
Their destiny is destruction, their god is their stomach, and their glory is in 
their shame. Their mind is set on earthly things.
	 --Philippians 3:19
%
But our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the 
Lord Jesus Christ,
	 --Philippians 3:20
%
who, by the power that enables him to bring everything under his control, will 
transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like his glorious body.
	 --Philippians 3:21
%
Therefore, my brothers and sisters, you whom I love and long for, my joy and 
crown, stand firm in the Lord in this way, dear friends!
	 --Philippians 4:1
%
I plead with Euodia and I plead with Syntyche to be of the same mind in the 
Lord.
	 --Philippians 4:2
%
Yes, and I ask you, my true companion, help these women since they have 
contended at my side in the cause of the gospel, along with Clement and the 
rest of my co-workers, whose names are in the book of life.
	 --Philippians 4:3
%
Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice!
	 --Philippians 4:4
%
Let your gentleness be evident to all. The Lord is near.
	 --Philippians 4:5
%
Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and 
petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.
	 --Philippians 4:6
%
And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your 
hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
	 --Philippians 4:7
%
Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is 
right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if 
anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things.
	 --Philippians 4:8
%
Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me—put it 
into practice. And the God of peace will be with you.
	 --Philippians 4:9
%
I rejoiced greatly in the Lord that at last you renewed your concern for me. 
Indeed, you were concerned, but you had no opportunity to show it.
	 --Philippians 4:10
%
I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content 
whatever the circumstances.
	 --Philippians 4:11
%
I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have 
learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well 
fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want.
	 --Philippians 4:12
%
I can do all this through him who gives me strength.
	 --Philippians 4:13
%
Yet it was good of you to share in my troubles.
	 --Philippians 4:14
%
Moreover, as you Philippians know, in the early days of your acquaintance with 
the gospel, when I set out from Macedonia, not one church shared with me in the 
matter of giving and receiving, except you only;
	 --Philippians 4:15
%
for even when I was in Thessalonica, you sent me aid more than once when I was 
in need.
	 --Philippians 4:16
%
Not that I desire your gifts; what I desire is that more be credited to your 
account.
	 --Philippians 4:17
%
I have received full payment and have more than enough. I am amply supplied, 
now that I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent. They are a 
fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God.
	 --Philippians 4:18
%
And my God will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory in 
Christ Jesus.
	 --Philippians 4:19
%
To our God and Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
	 --Philippians 4:20
%
Greet all God’s people in Christ Jesus. The brothers and sisters who are with 
me send greetings.
	 --Philippians 4:21
%
All God’s people here send you greetings, especially those who belong to 
Caesar’s household.
	 --Philippians 4:22
%
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.

On the Lord’s Day I was in the Spirit, and I heard behind me a loud voice 
like a trumpet,
	--Revelation 1:10
%
which said: “Write on a scroll what you see and send it to the seven 
churches: to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia and 
Laodicea.”
	--Revelation 1:11
%
I turned around to see the voice that was speaking to me. And when I turned I 
saw seven golden lampstands,
	--Revelation 1:12
%
and among the lampstands was someone like a son of man, dressed in a robe 
reaching down to his feet and with a golden sash around his chest.
	--Revelation 1:13
%
The hair on his head was white like wool, as white as snow, and his eyes were 
like blazing fire.
	--Revelation 1:14
%
His feet were like bronze glowing in a furnace, and his voice was like the 
sound of rushing waters.
	--Revelation 1:15
%
In his right hand he held seven stars, and coming out of his mouth was a sharp, 
double-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining in all its brilliance.
	--Revelation 1:16
%
When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. Then he placed his right 
hand on me and said: “Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last.
	--Revelation 1:17
%
I am the Living One; I was dead, and now look, I am alive for ever and ever! 
And I hold the keys of death and Hades.
	--Revelation 1:18
%
“Write, therefore, what you have seen, what is now and what will take place 
later.
	--Revelation 1:19
%
The mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and of the seven 
golden lampstands is this: The seven stars are the angels of the seven 
churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.
	--Revelation 1:20
%
“To the angel of the church in Ephesus write: These are the words of him who 
holds the seven stars in his right hand and walks among the seven golden 
lampstands.
	--Revelation 2:1
%
I know your deeds, your hard work and your perseverance. I know that you cannot 
tolerate wicked people, that you have tested those who claim to be apostles but 
are not, and have found them false.
	--Revelation 2:2
%
You have persevered and have endured hardships for my name, and have not grown 
weary.
	--Revelation 2:3
%
Yet I hold this against you: You have forsaken the love you had at first.
	--Revelation 2:4
%
Consider how far you have fallen! Repent and do the things you did at first. If 
you do not repent, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place.
	--Revelation 2:5
%
But you have this in your favor: You hate the practices of the Nicolaitans, 
which I also hate.
	--Revelation 2:6
%
Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the 
one who is victorious, I will give the right to eat from the tree of life, 
which is in the paradise of God.
	--Revelation 2:7
%
“To the angel of the church in Smyrna write: These are the words of him who 
is the First and the Last, who died and came to life again.
	--Revelation 2:8
%
I know your afflictions and your poverty—yet you are rich! I know about the 
slander of those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of 
Satan.
	--Revelation 2:9
%
Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer. I tell you, the devil will 
put some of you in prison to test you, and you will suffer persecution for ten 
days. Be faithful, even to the point of death, and I will give you life as your 
victor’s crown.
	--Revelation 2:10
%
Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches. The one 
who is victorious will not be hurt at all by the second death.
	--Revelation 2:11
%
“To the angel of the church in Pergamum write: These are the words of him who 
has the sharp, double-edged sword.
	--Revelation 2:12
%
I know where you live—where Satan has his throne. Yet you remain true to my 
name. You did not renounce your faith in me, not even in the days of Antipas, 
my faithful witness, who was put to death in your city—where Satan lives.
	--Revelation 2:13
%
Nevertheless, I have a few things against you: There are some among you who 
hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to entice the Israelites to 
sin so that they ate food sacrificed to idols and committed sexual immorality.
	--Revelation 2:14
%
Likewise, you also have those who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.
	--Revelation 2:15
%
Repent therefore! Otherwise, I will soon come to you and will fight against 
them with the sword of my mouth.
	--Revelation 2:16
%
Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the 
one who is victorious, I will give some of the hidden manna. I will also give 
that person a white stone with a new name written on it, known only to the one 
who receives it.
	--Revelation 2:17
%
“To the angel of the church in Thyatira write: These are the words of the Son 
of God, whose eyes are like blazing fire and whose feet are like burnished 
bronze.
	--Revelation 2:18
%
I know your deeds, your love and faith, your service and perseverance, and that 
you are now doing more than you did at first.
	--Revelation 2:19
%
Nevertheless, I have this against you: You tolerate that woman Jezebel, who 
calls herself a prophet. By her teaching she misleads my servants into sexual 
immorality and the eating of food sacrificed to idols.
	--Revelation 2:20
%
I have given her time to repent of her immorality, but she is unwilling.
	--Revelation 2:21
%
So I will cast her on a bed of suffering, and I will make those who commit 
adultery with her suffer intensely, unless they repent of her ways.
	--Revelation 2:22
%
I will strike her children dead. Then all the churches will know that I am he 
who searches hearts and minds, and I will repay each of you according to your 
deeds.
	--Revelation 2:23
%
Now I say to the rest of you in Thyatira, to you who do not hold to her 
teaching and have not learned Satan’s so-called deep secrets, ‘I will not 
impose any other burden on you,
	--Revelation 2:24
%
except to hold on to what you have until I come.’
	--Revelation 2:25
%
To the one who is victorious and does my will to the end, I will give authority 
over the nations—
	--Revelation 2:26
%
that one ‘will rule them with an iron scepter and will dash them to pieces 
like pottery’—just as I have received authority from my Father.
	--Revelation 2:27
%
I will also give that one the morning star.
	--Revelation 2:28
%
Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
	--Revelation 2:29
%
“To the angel of the church in Sardis write: These are the words of him who 
holds the seven spirits of God and the seven stars. I know your deeds; you have 
a reputation of being alive, but you are dead.
	--Revelation 3:1
%
Wake up! Strengthen what remains and is about to die, for I have found your 
deeds unfinished in the sight of my God.
	--Revelation 3:2
%
Remember, therefore, what you have received and heard; hold it fast, and 
repent. But if you do not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not 
know at what time I will come to you.
	--Revelation 3:3
%
Yet you have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their clothes. They 
will walk with me, dressed in white, for they are worthy.
	--Revelation 3:4
%
The one who is victorious will, like them, be dressed in white. I will never 
blot out the name of that person from the book of life, but will acknowledge 
that name before my Father and his angels.
	--Revelation 3:5
%
Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.

%
“To the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: These are the words of him 
who is holy and true, who holds the key of David. What he opens no one can 
shut, and what he shuts no one can open.
	--Revelation 3:7
%
I know your deeds. See, I have placed before you an open door that no one can 
shut. I know that you have little strength, yet you have kept my word and have 
not denied my name.
	--Revelation 3:8
%
I will make those who are of the synagogue of Satan, who claim to be Jews 
though they are not, but are liars—I will make them come and fall down at 
your feet and acknowledge that I have loved you.
	--Revelation 3:9
%
Since you have kept my command to endure patiently, I will also keep you from 
the hour of trial that is going to come on the whole world to test the 
inhabitants of the earth.
	--Revelation 3:10
%
I am coming soon. Hold on to what you have, so that no one will take your crown.
	--Revelation 3:11
%
The one who is victorious I will make a pillar in the temple of my God. Never 
again will they leave it. I will write on them the name of my God and the name 
of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which is coming down out of heaven 
from my God; and I will also write on them my new name.
	--Revelation 3:12
%
Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
	--Revelation 3:13
%
“To the angel of the church in Laodicea write: These are the words of the 
Amen, the faithful and true witness, the ruler of God’s creation.
	--Revelation 3:14
%
I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either 
one or the other!
	--Revelation 3:15
%
So, because you are lukewarm—neither hot nor cold—I am about to spit you 
out of my mouth.
	--Revelation 3:16
%
You say, ‘I am rich; I have acquired wealth and do not need a thing.’ But 
you do not realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind and naked.
	--Revelation 3:17
%
I counsel you to buy from me gold refined in the fire, so you can become rich; 
and white clothes to wear, so you can cover your shameful nakedness; and salve 
to put on your eyes, so you can see.
	--Revelation 3:18
%
Those whom I love I rebuke and discipline. So be earnest and repent.
	--Revelation 3:19
%
Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens 
the door, I will come in and eat with that person, and they with me.
	--Revelation 3:20
%
To the one who is victorious, I will give the right to sit with me on my 
throne, just as I was victorious and sat down with my Father on his throne.
	--Revelation 3:21
%
Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.”
	--Revelation 3:22
%
After this I looked, and there before me was a door standing open in heaven. 
And the voice I had first heard speaking to me like a trumpet said, “Come up 
here, and I will show you what must take place after this.”
	--Revelation 4:1
%
At once I was in the Spirit, and there before me was a throne in heaven with 
someone sitting on it.
	--Revelation 4:2
%
And the one who sat there had the appearance of jasper and ruby. A rainbow that 
shone like an emerald encircled the throne.
	--Revelation 4:3
%
Surrounding the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and seated on them were 
twenty-four elders. They were dressed in white and had crowns of gold on their 
heads.
	--Revelation 4:4
%
From the throne came flashes of lightning, rumblings and peals of thunder. In 
front of the throne, seven lamps were blazing. These are the seven spirits of 
God.
	--Revelation 4:5
%
Also in front of the throne there was what looked like a sea of glass, clear as 
crystal. In the center, around the throne, were four living creatures, and they 
were covered with eyes, in front and in back.
	--Revelation 4:6
%
The first living creature was like a lion, the second was like an ox, the third 
had a face like a man, the fourth was like a flying eagle.
	--Revelation 4:7
%
Each of the four living creatures had six wings and was covered with eyes all 
around, even under its wings. Day and night they never stop saying: “‘Holy, 
holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty,’ who was, and is, and is to come.”
	--Revelation 4:8
%
Whenever the living creatures give glory, honor and thanks to him who sits on 
the throne and who lives for ever and ever,
	--Revelation 4:9
%
the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne and worship 
him who lives for ever and ever. They lay their crowns before the throne and 
say:
	--Revelation 4:10
%
“You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for 
you created all things, and by your will they were created and have their 
being.”
	--Revelation 4:11
%
Then I saw in the right hand of him who sat on the throne a scroll with writing 
on both sides and sealed with seven seals.
	--Revelation 5:1
%
And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming in a loud voice, “Who is worthy to break 
the seals and open the scroll?”
	--Revelation 5:2
%
But no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth could open the scroll or 
even look inside it.
	--Revelation 5:3
%
I wept and wept because no one was found who was worthy to open the scroll or 
look inside.
	--Revelation 5:4
%
Then one of the elders said to me, “Do not weep! See, the Lion of the tribe 
of Judah, the Root of David, has triumphed. He is able to open the scroll and 
its seven seals.”
	--Revelation 5:5
%
Then I saw a Lamb, looking as if it had been slain, standing at the center of 
the throne, encircled by the four living creatures and the elders. The Lamb had 
seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into 
all the earth.
	--Revelation 5:6
%
He went and took the scroll from the right hand of him who sat on the throne.
	--Revelation 5:7
%
And when he had taken it, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders 
fell down before the Lamb. Each one had a harp and they were holding golden 
bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of God’s people.
	--Revelation 5:8
%
And they sang a new song, saying: “You are worthy to take the scroll and to 
open its seals, because you were slain, and with your blood you purchased for 
God persons from every tribe and language and people and nation.
	--Revelation 5:9
%
You have made them to be a kingdom and priests to serve our God, and they will 
reign on the earth.”
	--Revelation 5:10
%
Then I looked and heard the voice of many angels, numbering thousands upon 
thousands, and ten thousand times ten thousand. They encircled the throne and 
the living creatures and the elders.
	--Revelation 5:11
%
In a loud voice they were saying: “Worthy is the Lamb, who was slain, to 
receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and 
praise!”
	--Revelation 5:12
%
Then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on 
the sea, and all that is in them, saying: “To him who sits on the throne and 
to the Lamb be praise and honor and glory and power, for ever and ever!”
	--Revelation 5:13
%
The four living creatures said, “Amen,” and the elders fell down and 
worshiped.
	--Revelation 5:14
%
I watched as the Lamb opened the first of the seven seals. Then I heard one of 
the four living creatures say in a voice like thunder, “Come!”
	--Revelation 6:1
%
I looked, and there before me was a white horse! Its rider held a bow, and he 
was given a crown, and he rode out as a conqueror bent on conquest.
	--Revelation 6:2
%
When the Lamb opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, 
“Come!”
	--Revelation 6:3
%
Then another horse came out, a fiery red one. Its rider was given power to take 
peace from the earth and to make people kill each other. To him was given a 
large sword.
	--Revelation 6:4
%
When the Lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, 
“Come!” I looked, and there before me was a black horse! Its rider was 
holding a pair of scales in his hand.
	--Revelation 6:5
%
Then I heard what sounded like a voice among the four living creatures, saying, 
“Two pounds of wheat for a day’s wages, and six pounds of barley for a 
day’s wages, and do not damage the oil and the wine!”
	--Revelation 6:6
%
When the Lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living 
creature say, “Come!”
	--Revelation 6:7
%
I looked, and there before me was a pale horse! Its rider was named Death, and 
Hades was following close behind him. They were given power over a fourth of 
the earth to kill by sword, famine and plague, and by the wild beasts of the 
earth.
	--Revelation 6:8
%
When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had 
been slain because of the word of God and the testimony they had maintained.
	--Revelation 6:9
%
They called out in a loud voice, “How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, 
until you judge the inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood?”
	--Revelation 6:10
%
Then each of them was given a white robe, and they were told to wait a little 
longer, until the full number of their fellow servants, their brothers and 
sisters, were killed just as they had been.
	--Revelation 6:11
%
I watched as he opened the sixth seal. There was a great earthquake. The sun 
turned black like sackcloth made of goat hair, the whole moon turned blood red,
	--Revelation 6:12
%
and the stars in the sky fell to earth, as figs drop from a fig tree when 
shaken by a strong wind.
	--Revelation 6:13
%
The heavens receded like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and 
island was removed from its place.
	--Revelation 6:14
%
Then the kings of the earth, the princes, the generals, the rich, the mighty, 
and everyone else, both slave and free, hid in caves and among the rocks of the 
mountains.
	--Revelation 6:15
%
They called to the mountains and the rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the 
face of him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb!
	--Revelation 6:16
%
For the great day of their wrath has come, and who can withstand it?”
	--Revelation 6:17
%
After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding 
back the four winds of the earth to prevent any wind from blowing on the land 
or on the sea or on any tree.
	--Revelation 7:1
%
Then I saw another angel coming up from the east, having the seal of the living 
God. He called out in a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power 
to harm the land and the sea:
	--Revelation 7:2
%
“Do not harm the land or the sea or the trees until we put a seal on the 
foreheads of the servants of our God.”
	--Revelation 7:3
%
Then I heard the number of those who were sealed: 144,000 from all the tribes 
of Israel.
	--Revelation 7:4
%
From the tribe of Judah 12,000 were sealed, from the tribe of Reuben 12,000, 
from the tribe of Gad 12,000,
	--Revelation 7:5
%
from the tribe of Asher 12,000, from the tribe of Naphtali 12,000, from the 
tribe of Manasseh 12,000,
	--Revelation 7:6
%
from the tribe of Simeon 12,000, from the tribe of Levi 12,000, from the tribe 
of Issachar 12,000,
	--Revelation 7:7
%
from the tribe of Zebulun 12,000, from the tribe of Joseph 12,000, from the 
tribe of Benjamin 12,000.
	--Revelation 7:8
%
After this I looked, and there before me was a great multitude that no one 
could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language, standing before the 
throne and before the Lamb. They were wearing white robes and were holding palm 
branches in their hands.
	--Revelation 7:9
%
And they cried out in a loud voice: “Salvation belongs to our God, who sits 
on the throne, and to the Lamb.”
	--Revelation 7:10
%
All the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the 
four living creatures. They fell down on their faces before the throne and 
worshiped God,
	--Revelation 7:11
%
saying: “Amen! Praise and glory and wisdom and thanks and honor and power and 
strength be to our God for ever and ever. Amen!”
	--Revelation 7:12
%
Then one of the elders asked me, “These in white robes—who are they, and 
where did they come from?”
	--Revelation 7:13
%
I answered, “Sir, you know.” And he said, “These are they who have come 
out of the great tribulation; they have washed their robes and made them white 
in the blood of the Lamb.
	--Revelation 7:14
%
Therefore, “they are before the throne of God and serve him day and night in 
his temple; and he who sits on the throne will shelter them with his presence.
	--Revelation 7:15
%
‘Never again will they hunger; never again will they thirst. The sun will not 
beat down on them,’ nor any scorching heat.
	--Revelation 7:16
%
For the Lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd; ‘he will 
lead them to springs of living water.’ ‘And God will wipe away every tear 
from their eyes.’”
	--Revelation 7:17
%
When he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an 
hour.
	--Revelation 8:1
%
And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given 
to them.
	--Revelation 8:2
%
Another angel, who had a golden censer, came and stood at the altar. He was 
given much incense to offer, with the prayers of all God’s people, on the 
golden altar in front of the throne.
	--Revelation 8:3
%
The smoke of the incense, together with the prayers of God’s people, went up 
before God from the angel’s hand.
	--Revelation 8:4
%
Then the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and hurled 
it on the earth; and there came peals of thunder, rumblings, flashes of 
lightning and an earthquake.
	--Revelation 8:5
%
Then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to sound them.
	--Revelation 8:6
%
The first angel sounded his trumpet, and there came hail and fire mixed with 
blood, and it was hurled down on the earth. A third of the earth was burned up, 
a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up.
	--Revelation 8:7
%
The second angel sounded his trumpet, and something like a huge mountain, all 
ablaze, was thrown into the sea. A third of the sea turned into blood,
	--Revelation 8:8
%
a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were 
destroyed.
	--Revelation 8:9
%
The third angel sounded his trumpet, and a great star, blazing like a torch, 
fell from the sky on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water—
	--Revelation 8:10
%
the name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters turned bitter, and many 
people died from the waters that had become bitter.
	--Revelation 8:11
%
The fourth angel sounded his trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, a 
third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them turned 
dark. A third of the day was without light, and also a third of the night.
	--Revelation 8:12
%
As I watched, I heard an eagle that was flying in midair call out in a loud 
voice: “Woe! Woe! Woe to the inhabitants of the earth, because of the trumpet 
blasts about to be sounded by the other three angels!”
	--Revelation 8:13
%
The fifth angel sounded his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen from the 
sky to the earth. The star was given the key to the shaft of the Abyss.
	--Revelation 9:1
%
When he opened the Abyss, smoke rose from it like the smoke from a gigantic 
furnace. The sun and sky were darkened by the smoke from the Abyss.
	--Revelation 9:2
%
And out of the smoke locusts came down on the earth and were given power like 
that of scorpions of the earth.
	--Revelation 9:3
%
They were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any plant or tree, but 
only those people who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads.
	--Revelation 9:4
%
They were not allowed to kill them but only to torture them for five months. 
And the agony they suffered was like that of the sting of a scorpion when it 
strikes.
	--Revelation 9:5
%
During those days people will seek death but will not find it; they will long 
to die, but death will elude them.
	--Revelation 9:6
%
The locusts looked like horses prepared for battle. On their heads they wore 
something like crowns of gold, and their faces resembled human faces.
	--Revelation 9:7
%
Their hair was like women’s hair, and their teeth were like lions’ teeth.
	--Revelation 9:8
%
They had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings 
was like the thundering of many horses and chariots rushing into battle.
	--Revelation 9:9
%
They had tails with stingers, like scorpions, and in their tails they had power 
to torment people for five months.
	--Revelation 9:10
%
They had as king over them the angel of the Abyss, whose name in Hebrew is 
Abaddon and in Greek is Apollyon (that is, Destroyer).
	--Revelation 9:11
%
The first woe is past; two other woes are yet to come.
	--Revelation 9:12
%
The sixth angel sounded his trumpet, and I heard a voice coming from the four 
horns of the golden altar that is before God.
	--Revelation 9:13
%
It said to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, “Release the four angels who 
are bound at the great river Euphrates.”
	--Revelation 9:14
%
And the four angels who had been kept ready for this very hour and day and 
month and year were released to kill a third of mankind.
	--Revelation 9:15
%
The number of the mounted troops was twice ten thousand times ten thousand. I 
heard their number.
	--Revelation 9:16
%
The horses and riders I saw in my vision looked like this: Their breastplates 
were fiery red, dark blue, and yellow as sulfur. The heads of the horses 
resembled the heads of lions, and out of their mouths came fire, smoke and 
sulfur.
	--Revelation 9:17
%
A third of mankind was killed by the three plagues of fire, smoke and sulfur 
that came out of their mouths.
	--Revelation 9:18
%
The power of the horses was in their mouths and in their tails; for their tails 
were like snakes, having heads with which they inflict injury.
	--Revelation 9:19
%
The rest of mankind who were not killed by these plagues still did not repent 
of the work of their hands; they did not stop worshiping demons, and idols of 
gold, silver, bronze, stone and wood—idols that cannot see or hear or walk.
	--Revelation 9:20
%
Nor did they repent of their murders, their magic arts, their sexual immorality 
or their thefts.
	--Revelation 9:21
%
Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven. He was robed in a 
cloud, with a rainbow above his head; his face was like the sun, and his legs 
were like fiery pillars.
	--Revelation 10:1
%
He was holding a little scroll, which lay open in his hand. He planted his 
right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land,
	--Revelation 10:2
%
and he gave a loud shout like the roar of a lion. When he shouted, the voices 
of the seven thunders spoke.
	--Revelation 10:3
%
And when the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write; but I heard a voice 
from heaven say, “Seal up what the seven thunders have said and do not write 
it down.”
	--Revelation 10:4
%
Then the angel I had seen standing on the sea and on the land raised his right 
hand to heaven.
	--Revelation 10:5
%
And he swore by him who lives for ever and ever, who created the heavens and 
all that is in them, the earth and all that is in it, and the sea and all that 
is in it, and said, “There will be no more delay!
	--Revelation 10:6
%
But in the days when the seventh angel is about to sound his trumpet, the 
mystery of God will be accomplished, just as he announced to his servants the 
prophets.”
	--Revelation 10:7
%
Then the voice that I had heard from heaven spoke to me once more: “Go, take 
the scroll that lies open in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea 
and on the land.”
	--Revelation 10:8
%
So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the little scroll. He said to 
me, “Take it and eat it. It will turn your stomach sour, but ‘in your mouth 
it will be as sweet as honey.’”
	--Revelation 10:9
%
I took the little scroll from the angel’s hand and ate it. It tasted as sweet 
as honey in my mouth, but when I had eaten it, my stomach turned sour.
	--Revelation 10:10
%
Then I was told, “You must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, 
languages and kings.”
	--Revelation 10:11
%
I was given a reed like a measuring rod and was told, “Go and measure the 
temple of God and the altar, with its worshipers.
	--Revelation 11:1
%
But exclude the outer court; do not measure it, because it has been given to 
the Gentiles. They will trample on the holy city for 42 months.
	--Revelation 11:2
%
And I will appoint my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for 1,260 days, 
clothed in sackcloth.”
	--Revelation 11:3
%
They are “the two olive trees” and the two lampstands, and “they stand 
before the Lord of the earth.”
	--Revelation 11:4
%
If anyone tries to harm them, fire comes from their mouths and devours their 
enemies. This is how anyone who wants to harm them must die.
	--Revelation 11:5
%
They have power to shut up the heavens so that it will not rain during the time 
they are prophesying; and they have power to turn the waters into blood and to 
strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they want.
	--Revelation 11:6
%
Now when they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up from the 
Abyss will attack them, and overpower and kill them.
	--Revelation 11:7
%
Their bodies will lie in the public square of the great city—which is 
figuratively called Sodom and Egypt—where also their Lord was crucified.
	--Revelation 11:8
%
For three and a half days some from every people, tribe, language and nation 
will gaze on their bodies and refuse them burial.
	--Revelation 11:9
%
The inhabitants of the earth will gloat over them and will celebrate by sending 
each other gifts, because these two prophets had tormented those who live on 
the earth.
	--Revelation 11:10
%
But after the three and a half days the breath of life from God entered them, 
and they stood on their feet, and terror struck those who saw them.
	--Revelation 11:11
%
Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, “Come up here.” 
And they went up to heaven in a cloud, while their enemies looked on.
	--Revelation 11:12
%
At that very hour there was a severe earthquake and a tenth of the city 
collapsed. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the 
survivors were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.
	--Revelation 11:13
%
The second woe has passed; the third woe is coming soon.
	--Revelation 11:14
%
The seventh angel sounded his trumpet, and there were loud voices in heaven, 
which said: “The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and 
of his Messiah, and he will reign for ever and ever.”
	--Revelation 11:15
%
And the twenty-four elders, who were seated on their thrones before God, fell 
on their faces and worshiped God,
	--Revelation 11:16
%
saying: “We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty, the One who is and who 
was, because you have taken your great power and have begun to reign.
	--Revelation 11:17
%
The nations were angry, and your wrath has come. The time has come for judging 
the dead, and for rewarding your servants the prophets and your people who 
revere your name, both great and small— and for destroying those who destroy 
the earth.”
	--Revelation 11:18
%
Then God’s temple in heaven was opened, and within his temple was seen the 
ark of his covenant. And there came flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of 
thunder, an earthquake and a severe hailstorm.
	--Revelation 11:19
%
A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon 
under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head.
	--Revelation 12:1
%
She was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth.
	--Revelation 12:2
%
Then another sign appeared in heaven: an enormous red dragon with seven heads 
and ten horns and seven crowns on its heads.
	--Revelation 12:3
%
Its tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the earth. 
The dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth, so that it 
might devour her child the moment he was born.
	--Revelation 12:4
%
She gave birth to a son, a male child, who “will rule all the nations with an 
iron scepter.” And her child was snatched up to God and to his throne.
	--Revelation 12:5
%
The woman fled into the wilderness to a place prepared for her by God, where 
she might be taken care of for 1,260 days.
	--Revelation 12:6
%
Then war broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, 
and the dragon and his angels fought back.
	--Revelation 12:7
%
But he was not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven.
	--Revelation 12:8
%
The great dragon was hurled down—that ancient serpent called the devil, or 
Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his 
angels with him.
	--Revelation 12:9
%
Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say: “Now have come the salvation and the 
power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Messiah. For the 
accuser of our brothers and sisters, who accuses them before our God day and 
night, has been hurled down.
	--Revelation 12:10
%
They triumphed over him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their 
testimony; they did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death.
	--Revelation 12:11
%
Therefore rejoice, you heavens and you who dwell in them! But woe to the earth 
and the sea, because the devil has gone down to you! He is filled with fury, 
because he knows that his time is short.”
	--Revelation 12:12
%
When the dragon saw that he had been hurled to the earth, he pursued the woman 
who had given birth to the male child.
	--Revelation 12:13
%
The woman was given the two wings of a great eagle, so that she might fly to 
the place prepared for her in the wilderness, where she would be taken care of 
for a time, times and half a time, out of the serpent’s reach.
	--Revelation 12:14
%
Then from his mouth the serpent spewed water like a river, to overtake the 
woman and sweep her away with the torrent.
	--Revelation 12:15
%
But the earth helped the woman by opening its mouth and swallowing the river 
that the dragon had spewed out of his mouth.
	--Revelation 12:16
%
Then the dragon was enraged at the woman and went off to wage war against the 
rest of her offspring—those who keep God’s commands and hold fast their 
testimony about Jesus.
	--Revelation 12:17
%
The dragon stood on the shore of the sea. And I saw a beast coming out of the 
sea. It had ten horns and seven heads, with ten crowns on its horns, and on 
each head a blasphemous name.
	--Revelation 13:1
%
The beast I saw resembled a leopard, but had feet like those of a bear and a 
mouth like that of a lion. The dragon gave the beast his power and his throne 
and great authority.
	--Revelation 13:2
%
One of the heads of the beast seemed to have had a fatal wound, but the fatal 
wound had been healed. The whole world was filled with wonder and followed the 
beast.
	--Revelation 13:3
%
People worshiped the dragon because he had given authority to the beast, and 
they also worshiped the beast and asked, “Who is like the beast? Who can wage 
war against it?”
	--Revelation 13:4
%
The beast was given a mouth to utter proud words and blasphemies and to 
exercise its authority for forty-two months.
	--Revelation 13:5
%
It opened its mouth to blaspheme God, and to slander his name and his dwelling 
place and those who live in heaven.
	--Revelation 13:6
%
It was given power to wage war against God’s holy people and to conquer them. 
And it was given authority over every tribe, people, language and nation.
	--Revelation 13:7
%
All inhabitants of the earth will worship the beast—all whose names have not 
been written in the Lamb’s book of life, the Lamb who was slain from the 
creation of the world.
	--Revelation 13:8
%
Whoever has ears, let them hear.
	--Revelation 13:9
%
“If anyone is to go into captivity, into captivity they will go. If anyone is 
to be killed with the sword, with the sword they will be killed.” This calls 
for patient endurance and faithfulness on the part of God’s people.
	--Revelation 13:10
%
Then I saw a second beast, coming out of the earth. It had two horns like a 
lamb, but it spoke like a dragon.
	--Revelation 13:11
%
It exercised all the authority of the first beast on its behalf, and made the 
earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose fatal wound had been 
healed.
	--Revelation 13:12
%
And it performed great signs, even causing fire to come down from heaven to the 
earth in full view of the people.
	--Revelation 13:13
%
Because of the signs it was given power to perform on behalf of the first 
beast, it deceived the inhabitants of the earth. It ordered them to set up an 
image in honor of the beast who was wounded by the sword and yet lived.
	--Revelation 13:14
%
The second beast was given power to give breath to the image of the first 
beast, so that the image could speak and cause all who refused to worship the 
image to be killed.
	--Revelation 13:15
%
It also forced all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to 
receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads,
	--Revelation 13:16
%
so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is the name 
of the beast or the number of its name.
	--Revelation 13:17
%
This calls for wisdom. Let the person who has insight calculate the number of 
the beast, for it is the number of a man. That number is 666.
	--Revelation 13:18
%
Then I looked, and there before me was the Lamb, standing on Mount Zion, and 
with him 144,000 who had his name and his Father’s name written on their 
foreheads.
	--Revelation 14:1
%
And I heard a sound from heaven like the roar of rushing waters and like a loud 
peal of thunder. The sound I heard was like that of harpists playing their 
harps.
	--Revelation 14:2
%
And they sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures 
and the elders. No one could learn the song except the 144,000 who had been 
redeemed from the earth.
	--Revelation 14:3
%
These are those who did not defile themselves with women, for they remained 
virgins. They follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They were purchased from among 
mankind and offered as firstfruits to God and the Lamb.
	--Revelation 14:4
%
No lie was found in their mouths; they are blameless.
	--Revelation 14:5
%
Then I saw another angel flying in midair, and he had the eternal gospel to 
proclaim to those who live on the earth—to every nation, tribe, language and 
people.
	--Revelation 14:6
%
He said in a loud voice, “Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of 
his judgment has come. Worship him who made the heavens, the earth, the sea and 
the springs of water.”
	--Revelation 14:7
%
A second angel followed and said, “‘Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great,’ 
which made all the nations drink the maddening wine of her adulteries.”
	--Revelation 14:8
%
A third angel followed them and said in a loud voice: “If anyone worships the 
beast and its image and receives its mark on their forehead or on their hand,
	--Revelation 14:9
%
they, too, will drink the wine of God’s fury, which has been poured full 
strength into the cup of his wrath. They will be tormented with burning sulfur 
in the presence of the holy angels and of the Lamb.
	--Revelation 14:10
%
And the smoke of their torment will rise for ever and ever. There will be no 
rest day or night for those who worship the beast and its image, or for anyone 
who receives the mark of its name.”
	--Revelation 14:11
%
This calls for patient endurance on the part of the people of God who keep his 
commands and remain faithful to Jesus.
	--Revelation 14:12
%
Then I heard a voice from heaven say, “Write this: Blessed are the dead who 
die in the Lord from now on.” “Yes,” says the Spirit, “they will rest 
from their labor, for their deeds will follow them.”
	--Revelation 14:13
%
I looked, and there before me was a white cloud, and seated on the cloud was 
one like a son of man with a crown of gold on his head and a sharp sickle in 
his hand.
	--Revelation 14:14
%
Then another angel came out of the temple and called in a loud voice to him who 
was sitting on the cloud, “Take your sickle and reap, because the time to 
reap has come, for the harvest of the earth is ripe.”
	--Revelation 14:15
%
So he who was seated on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and the 
earth was harvested.
	--Revelation 14:16
%
Another angel came out of the temple in heaven, and he too had a sharp sickle.
	--Revelation 14:17
%
Still another angel, who had charge of the fire, came from the altar and called 
in a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, “Take your sharp sickle and 
gather the clusters of grapes from the earth’s vine, because its grapes are 
ripe.”
	--Revelation 14:18
%
The angel swung his sickle on the earth, gathered its grapes and threw them 
into the great winepress of God’s wrath.
	--Revelation 14:19
%
They were trampled in the winepress outside the city, and blood flowed out of 
the press, rising as high as the horses’ bridles for a distance of 1,600 
stadia.
	--Revelation 14:20
%
I saw in heaven another great and marvelous sign: seven angels with the seven 
last plagues—last, because with them God’s wrath is completed.
	--Revelation 15:1
%
And I saw what looked like a sea of glass glowing with fire and, standing 
beside the sea, those who had been victorious over the beast and its image and 
over the number of its name. They held harps given them by God
	--Revelation 15:2
%
and sang the song of God’s servant Moses and of the Lamb: “Great and 
marvelous are your deeds, Lord God Almighty. Just and true are your ways, King 
of the nations.
	--Revelation 15:3
%
Who will not fear you, Lord, and bring glory to your name? For you alone are 
holy. All nations will come and worship before you, for your righteous acts 
have been revealed.”
	--Revelation 15:4
%
After this I looked, and I saw in heaven the temple—that is, the tabernacle 
of the covenant law—and it was opened.
	--Revelation 15:5
%
Out of the temple came the seven angels with the seven plagues. They were 
dressed in clean, shining linen and wore golden sashes around their chests.
	--Revelation 15:6
%
Then one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden 
bowls filled with the wrath of God, who lives for ever and ever.
	--Revelation 15:7
%
And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power, 
and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels 
were completed.
	--Revelation 15:8
%
Then I heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels, “Go, 
pour out the seven bowls of God’s wrath on the earth.”
	--Revelation 16:1
%
The first angel went and poured out his bowl on the land, and ugly, festering 
sores broke out on the people who had the mark of the beast and worshiped its 
image.
	--Revelation 16:2
%
The second angel poured out his bowl on the sea, and it turned into blood like 
that of a dead person, and every living thing in the sea died.
	--Revelation 16:3
%
The third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and springs of water, and 
they became blood.
	--Revelation 16:4
%
Then I heard the angel in charge of the waters say: “You are just in these 
judgments, O Holy One, you who are and who were;
	--Revelation 16:5
%
for they have shed the blood of your holy people and your prophets, and you 
have given them blood to drink as they deserve.”
	--Revelation 16:6
%
And I heard the altar respond: “Yes, Lord God Almighty, true and just are 
your judgments.”
	--Revelation 16:7
%
The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and the sun was allowed to 
scorch people with fire.
	--Revelation 16:8
%
They were seared by the intense heat and they cursed the name of God, who had 
control over these plagues, but they refused to repent and glorify him.
	--Revelation 16:9
%
The fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and its kingdom 
was plunged into darkness. People gnawed their tongues in agony
	--Revelation 16:10
%
and cursed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, but they 
refused to repent of what they had done.
	--Revelation 16:11
%
The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water 
was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the East.
	--Revelation 16:12
%
Then I saw three impure spirits that looked like frogs; they came out of the 
mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the 
false prophet.
	--Revelation 16:13
%
They are demonic spirits that perform signs, and they go out to the kings of 
the whole world, to gather them for the battle on the great day of God Almighty.
	--Revelation 16:14
%
“Look, I come like a thief! Blessed is the one who stays awake and remains 
clothed, so as not to go naked and be shamefully exposed.”
	--Revelation 16:15
%
Then they gathered the kings together to the place that in Hebrew is called 
Armageddon.
	--Revelation 16:16
%
The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air, and out of the temple came 
a loud voice from the throne, saying, “It is done!”
	--Revelation 16:17
%
Then there came flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder and a severe 
earthquake. No earthquake like it has ever occurred since mankind has been on 
earth, so tremendous was the quake.
	--Revelation 16:18
%
The great city split into three parts, and the cities of the nations collapsed. 
God remembered Babylon the Great and gave her the cup filled with the wine of 
the fury of his wrath.
	--Revelation 16:19
%
Every island fled away and the mountains could not be found.
	--Revelation 16:20
%
From the sky huge hailstones, each weighing about a hundred pounds, fell on 
people. And they cursed God on account of the plague of hail, because the 
plague was so terrible.
	--Revelation 16:21
%
One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and said to me, “Come, I 
will show you the punishment of the great prostitute, who sits by many waters.
	--Revelation 17:1
%
With her the kings of the earth committed adultery, and the inhabitants of the 
earth were intoxicated with the wine of her adulteries.”
	--Revelation 17:2
%
Then the angel carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness. There I saw a 
woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was covered with blasphemous names and 
had seven heads and ten horns.
	--Revelation 17:3
%
The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and was glittering with gold, 
precious stones and pearls. She held a golden cup in her hand, filled with 
abominable things and the filth of her adulteries.
	--Revelation 17:4
%
The name written on her forehead was a mystery: babylon the great the mother of 
prostitutes and of the abominations of the earth.
	--Revelation 17:5
%
I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of God’s holy people, the blood 
of those who bore testimony to Jesus. When I saw her, I was greatly astonished.
	--Revelation 17:6
%
Then the angel said to me: “Why are you astonished? I will explain to you the 
mystery of the woman and of the beast she rides, which has the seven heads and 
ten horns.
	--Revelation 17:7
%
The beast, which you saw, once was, now is not, and yet will come up out of the 
Abyss and go to its destruction. The inhabitants of the earth whose names have 
not been written in the book of life from the creation of the world will be 
astonished when they see the beast, because it once was, now is not, and yet 
will come.
	--Revelation 17:8
%
“This calls for a mind with wisdom. The seven heads are seven hills on which 
the woman sits.
	--Revelation 17:9
%
They are also seven kings. Five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet 
come; but when he does come, he must remain for only a little while.
	--Revelation 17:10
%
The beast who once was, and now is not, is an eighth king. He belongs to the 
seven and is going to his destruction.
	--Revelation 17:11
%
“The ten horns you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but 
who for one hour will receive authority as kings along with the beast.
	--Revelation 17:12
%
They have one purpose and will give their power and authority to the beast.
	--Revelation 17:13
%
They will wage war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will triumph over them 
because he is Lord of lords and King of kings—and with him will be his 
called, chosen and faithful followers.”
	--Revelation 17:14
%
Then the angel said to me, “The waters you saw, where the prostitute sits, 
are peoples, multitudes, nations and languages.
	--Revelation 17:15
%
The beast and the ten horns you saw will hate the prostitute. They will bring 
her to ruin and leave her naked; they will eat her flesh and burn her with fire.
	--Revelation 17:16
%
For God has put it into their hearts to accomplish his purpose by agreeing to 
hand over to the beast their royal authority, until God’s words are fulfilled.
	--Revelation 17:17
%
The woman you saw is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth.”
	--Revelation 17:18
%
After this I saw another angel coming down from heaven. He had great authority, 
and the earth was illuminated by his splendor.
	--Revelation 18:1
%
With a mighty voice he shouted: “‘Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great!’ 
She has become a dwelling for demons and a haunt for every impure spirit, a 
haunt for every unclean bird, a haunt for every unclean and detestable animal.
	--Revelation 18:2
%
For all the nations have drunk the maddening wine of her adulteries. The kings 
of the earth committed adultery with her, and the merchants of the earth grew 
rich from her excessive luxuries.”
	--Revelation 18:3
%
Then I heard another voice from heaven say: “‘Come out of her, my 
people,’ so that you will not share in her sins, so that you will not receive 
any of her plagues;
	--Revelation 18:4
%
for her sins are piled up to heaven, and God has remembered her crimes.
	--Revelation 18:5
%
Give back to her as she has given; pay her back double for what she has done. 
Pour her a double portion from her own cup.
	--Revelation 18:6
%
Give her as much torment and grief as the glory and luxury she gave herself. In 
her heart she boasts, ‘I sit enthroned as queen. I am not a widow; I will 
never mourn.’
	--Revelation 18:7
%
Therefore in one day her plagues will overtake her: death, mourning and famine. 
She will be consumed by fire, for mighty is the Lord God who judges her.
	--Revelation 18:8
%
“When the kings of the earth who committed adultery with her and shared her 
luxury see the smoke of her burning, they will weep and mourn over her.
	--Revelation 18:9
%
Terrified at her torment, they will stand far off and cry: “‘Woe! Woe to 
you, great city, you mighty city of Babylon! In one hour your doom has come!’
	--Revelation 18:10
%
“The merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her because no one buys 
their cargoes anymore—
	--Revelation 18:11
%
cargoes of gold, silver, precious stones and pearls; fine linen, purple, silk 
and scarlet cloth; every sort of citron wood, and articles of every kind made 
of ivory, costly wood, bronze, iron and marble;
	--Revelation 18:12
%
cargoes of cinnamon and spice, of incense, myrrh and frankincense, of wine and 
olive oil, of fine flour and wheat; cattle and sheep; horses and carriages; and 
human beings sold as slaves.
	--Revelation 18:13
%
“They will say, ‘The fruit you longed for is gone from you. All your luxury 
and splendor have vanished, never to be recovered.’
	--Revelation 18:14
%
The merchants who sold these things and gained their wealth from her will stand 
far off, terrified at her torment. They will weep and mourn
	--Revelation 18:15
%
and cry out: “‘Woe! Woe to you, great city, dressed in fine linen, purple 
and scarlet, and glittering with gold, precious stones and pearls!
	--Revelation 18:16
%
In one hour such great wealth has been brought to ruin!’ “Every sea 
captain, and all who travel by ship, the sailors, and all who earn their living 
from the sea, will stand far off.
	--Revelation 18:17
%
When they see the smoke of her burning, they will exclaim, ‘Was there ever a 
city like this great city?’
	--Revelation 18:18
%
They will throw dust on their heads, and with weeping and mourning cry out: 
“‘Woe! Woe to you, great city, where all who had ships on the sea became 
rich through her wealth! In one hour she has been brought to ruin!’
	--Revelation 18:19
%
“Rejoice over her, you heavens! Rejoice, you people of God! Rejoice, apostles 
and prophets! For God has judged her with the judgment she imposed on you.”
	--Revelation 18:20
%
Then a mighty angel picked up a boulder the size of a large millstone and threw 
it into the sea, and said: “With such violence the great city of Babylon will 
be thrown down, never to be found again.
	--Revelation 18:21
%
The music of harpists and musicians, pipers and trumpeters, will never be heard 
in you again. No worker of any trade will ever be found in you again. The sound 
of a millstone will never be heard in you again.
	--Revelation 18:22
%
The light of a lamp will never shine in you again. The voice of bridegroom and 
bride will never be heard in you again. Your merchants were the world’s 
important people. By your magic spell all the nations were led astray.
	--Revelation 18:23
%
In her was found the blood of prophets and of God’s holy people, of all who 
have been slaughtered on the earth.”
	--Revelation 18:24
%
After this I heard what sounded like the roar of a great multitude in heaven 
shouting: “Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God,
	--Revelation 19:1
%
    for true and just are his judgments. He has condemned the great 
prostitute who corrupted the earth by her adulteries. He has avenged on her the 
blood of his servants.”
	--Revelation 19:2
%
And again they shouted: “Hallelujah! The smoke from her goes up for ever and 
ever.”
	--Revelation 19:3
%
The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped 
God, who was seated on the throne. And they cried: “Amen, Hallelujah!”
	--Revelation 19:4
%
Then a voice came from the throne, saying: “Praise our God, all you his 
servants, you who fear him, both great and small!”
	--Revelation 19:5
%
Then I heard what sounded like a great multitude, like the roar of rushing 
waters and like loud peals of thunder, shouting: “Hallelujah! For our Lord 
God Almighty reigns.
	--Revelation 19:6
%
Let us rejoice and be glad and give him glory! For the wedding of the Lamb has 
come, and his bride has made herself ready.
	--Revelation 19:7
%
Fine linen, bright and clean, was given her to wear.” (Fine linen stands for 
the righteous acts of God’s holy people.)
	--Revelation 19:8
%
Then the angel said to me, “Write this: Blessed are those who are invited to 
the wedding supper of the Lamb!” And he added, “These are the true words of 
God.”
	--Revelation 19:9
%
At this I fell at his feet to worship him. But he said to me, “Don’t do 
that! I am a fellow servant with you and with your brothers and sisters who 
hold to the testimony of Jesus. Worship God! For it is the Spirit of prophecy 
who bears testimony to Jesus.”
	--Revelation 19:10
%
I saw heaven standing open and there before me was a white horse, whose rider 
is called Faithful and True. With justice he judges and wages war.
	--Revelation 19:11
%
His eyes are like blazing fire, and on his head are many crowns. He has a name 
written on him that no one knows but he himself.
	--Revelation 19:12
%
He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood, and his name is the Word of God.
	--Revelation 19:13
%
The armies of heaven were following him, riding on white horses and dressed in 
fine linen, white and clean.
	--Revelation 19:14
%
Coming out of his mouth is a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations. 
“He will rule them with an iron scepter.” He treads the winepress of the 
fury of the wrath of God Almighty.
	--Revelation 19:15
%
On his robe and on his thigh he has this name written: king of kings and lord 
of lords.
	--Revelation 19:16
%
And I saw an angel standing in the sun, who cried in a loud voice to all the 
birds flying in midair, “Come, gather together for the great supper of God,
	--Revelation 19:17
%
so that you may eat the flesh of kings, generals, and the mighty, of horses and 
their riders, and the flesh of all people, free and slave, great and small.”
	--Revelation 19:18
%
Then I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered 
together to wage war against the rider on the horse and his army.
	--Revelation 19:19
%
But the beast was captured, and with it the false prophet who had performed the 
signs on its behalf. With these signs he had deluded those who had received the 
mark of the beast and worshiped its image. The two of them were thrown alive 
into the fiery lake of burning sulfur.
	--Revelation 19:20
%
The rest were killed with the sword coming out of the mouth of the rider on the 
horse, and all the birds gorged themselves on their flesh.
	--Revelation 19:21
%
And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key to the Abyss and 
holding in his hand a great chain.
	--Revelation 20:1
%
He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil, or Satan, and 
bound him for a thousand years.
	--Revelation 20:2
%
He threw him into the Abyss, and locked and sealed it over him, to keep him 
from deceiving the nations anymore until the thousand years were ended. After 
that, he must be set free for a short time.
	--Revelation 20:3
%
I saw thrones on which were seated those who had been given authority to judge. 
And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony 
about Jesus and because of the word of God. They had not worshiped the beast or 
its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands. They 
came to life and reigned with Christ a thousand years.
	--Revelation 20:4
%
(The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were 
ended.) This is the first resurrection.
	--Revelation 20:5
%
Blessed and holy are those who share in the first resurrection. The second 
death has no power over them, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and 
will reign with him for a thousand years.
	--Revelation 20:6
%
When the thousand years are over, Satan will be released from his prison
	--Revelation 20:7
%
and will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the earth—Gog 
and Magog—and to gather them for battle. In number they are like the sand on 
the seashore.
	--Revelation 20:8
%
They marched across the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of God’s 
people, the city he loves. But fire came down from heaven and devoured them.
	--Revelation 20:9
%
And the devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur, 
where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown. They will be tormented 
day and night for ever and ever.
	--Revelation 20:10
%
Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. The earth and the 
heavens fled from his presence, and there was no place for them.
	--Revelation 20:11
%
And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were 
opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were 
judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books.
	--Revelation 20:12
%
The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead 
that were in them, and each person was judged according to what they had done.
	--Revelation 20:13
%
Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the 
second death.
	--Revelation 20:14
%
Anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the 
lake of fire.
	--Revelation 20:15
%
Then I saw “a new heaven and a new earth,” for the first heaven and the 
first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea.
	--Revelation 21:1
%
I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, 
prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband.
	--Revelation 21:2
%
And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Look! God’s dwelling 
place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them. They will be his 
people, and God himself will be with them and be their God.
	--Revelation 21:3
%
‘He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death’ or 
mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.”
	--Revelation 21:4
%
He who was seated on the throne said, “I am making everything new!” Then he 
said, “Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.”
	--Revelation 21:5
%
He said to me: “It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and 
the End. To the thirsty I will give water without cost from the spring of the 
water of life.
	--Revelation 21:6
%
Those who are victorious will inherit all this, and I will be their God and 
they will be my children.
	--Revelation 21:7
%
But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually 
immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars—they will 
be consigned to the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death.”
	--Revelation 21:8
%
One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues 
came and said to me, “Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the 
Lamb.”
	--Revelation 21:9
%
And he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high, and showed 
me the Holy City, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God.
	--Revelation 21:10
%
It shone with the glory of God, and its brilliance was like that of a very 
precious jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal.
	--Revelation 21:11
%
It had a great, high wall with twelve gates, and with twelve angels at the 
gates. On the gates were written the names of the twelve tribes of Israel.
	--Revelation 21:12
%
There were three gates on the east, three on the north, three on the south and 
three on the west.
	--Revelation 21:13
%
The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the 
twelve apostles of the Lamb.
	--Revelation 21:14
%
The angel who talked with me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city, 
its gates and its walls.
	--Revelation 21:15
%
The city was laid out like a square, as long as it was wide. He measured the 
city with the rod and found it to be 12,000 stadia in length, and as wide and 
high as it is long.
	--Revelation 21:16
%
The angel measured the wall using human measurement, and it was 144 cubits 
thick.
	--Revelation 21:17
%
The wall was made of jasper, and the city of pure gold, as pure as glass.
	--Revelation 21:18
%
The foundations of the city walls were decorated with every kind of precious 
stone. The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, 
the fourth emerald,
	--Revelation 21:19
%
the fifth onyx, the sixth ruby, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the 
ninth topaz, the tenth turquoise, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth 
amethyst.
	--Revelation 21:20
%
The twelve gates were twelve pearls, each gate made of a single pearl. The 
great street of the city was of gold, as pure as transparent glass.
	--Revelation 21:21
%
I did not see a temple in the city, because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb 
are its temple.
	--Revelation 21:22
%
The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God 
gives it light, and the Lamb is its lamp.
	--Revelation 21:23
%
The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their 
splendor into it.
	--Revelation 21:24
%
On no day will its gates ever be shut, for there will be no night there.
	--Revelation 21:25
%
The glory and honor of the nations will be brought into it.
	--Revelation 21:26
%
Nothing impure will ever enter it, nor will anyone who does what is shameful or 
deceitful, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb’s book of life.
	--Revelation 21:27
%
Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, as clear as crystal, 
flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb
	--Revelation 22:1
%
down the middle of the great street of the city. On each side of the river 
stood the tree of life, bearing twelve crops of fruit, yielding its fruit every 
month. And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.
	--Revelation 22:2
%
No longer will there be any curse. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in 
the city, and his servants will serve him.
	--Revelation 22:3
%
They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.
	--Revelation 22:4
%
There will be no more night. They will not need the light of a lamp or the 
light of the sun, for the Lord God will give them light. And they will reign 
for ever and ever.
	--Revelation 22:5
%
The angel said to me, “These words are trustworthy and true. The Lord, the 
God who inspires the prophets, sent his angel to show his servants the things 
that must soon take place.”
	--Revelation 22:6
%
“Look, I am coming soon! Blessed is the one who keeps the words of the 
prophecy written in this scroll.”
	--Revelation 22:7
%
I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. And when I had heard and 
seen them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who had been showing 
them to me.
	--Revelation 22:8
%
But he said to me, “Don’t do that! I am a fellow servant with you and with 
your fellow prophets and with all who keep the words of this scroll. Worship 
God!”
	--Revelation 22:9
%
Then he told me, “Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this scroll, 
because the time is near.
	--Revelation 22:10
%
Let the one who does wrong continue to do wrong; let the vile person continue 
to be vile; let the one who does right continue to do right; and let the holy 
person continue to be holy.”
	--Revelation 22:11
%
“Look, I am coming soon! My reward is with me, and I will give to each person 
according to what they have done.
	--Revelation 22:12
%
I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.
	--Revelation 22:13
%
“Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have the right to the 
tree of life and may go through the gates into the city.
	--Revelation 22:14
%
Outside are the dogs, those who practice magic arts, the sexually immoral, the 
murderers, the idolaters and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.
	--Revelation 22:15
%
“I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give you this testimony for the churches. I 
am the Root and the Offspring of David, and the bright Morning Star.”
	--Revelation 22:16
%
The Spirit and the bride say, “Come!” And let the one who hears say, 
“Come!” Let the one who is thirsty come; and let the one who wishes take 
the free gift of the water of life.
	--Revelation 22:17
%
I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this scroll: If anyone 
adds anything to them, God will add to that person the plagues described in 
this scroll.
	--Revelation 22:18
%
And if anyone takes words away from this scroll of prophecy, God will take away 
from that person any share in the tree of life and in the Holy City, which are 
described in this scroll.
	--Revelation 22:19
%
He who testifies to these things says, “Yes, I am coming soon.” Amen. Come, 
Lord Jesus.
	--Revelation 22:20
%
The grace of the Lord Jesus be with God’s people. Amen.
	--Revelation 22:21
%
Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle and set apart for the 
gospel of God—
	--Romans 1:1
%
the gospel he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures
	--Romans 1:2
%
regarding his Son, who as to his earthly life was a descendant of David,
	--Romans 1:3
%
and who through the Spirit of holiness was appointed the Son of God in power by 
his resurrection from the dead: Jesus Christ our Lord.
	--Romans 1:4
%
Through him we received grace and apostleship to call all the Gentiles to the 
obedience that comes from faith for his name’s sake.
	--Romans 1:5
%
And you also are among those Gentiles who are called to belong to Jesus Christ.
	--Romans 1:6
%
To all in Rome who are loved by God and called to be his holy people: Grace and 
peace to you from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
	--Romans 1:7
%
First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith 
is being reported all over the world.
	--Romans 1:8
%
God, whom I serve in my spirit in preaching the gospel of his Son, is my 
witness how constantly I remember you
	--Romans 1:9
%
in my prayers at all times; and I pray that now at last by God’s will the way 
may be opened for me to come to you.
	--Romans 1:10
%
I long to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to make you 
strong—
	--Romans 1:11
%
that is, that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other’s faith.
	--Romans 1:12
%
I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, that I planned many 
times to come to you (but have been prevented from doing so until now) in order 
that I might have a harvest among you, just as I have had among the other 
Gentiles.
	--Romans 1:13
%
I am obligated both to Greeks and non-Greeks, both to the wise and the foolish.
	--Romans 1:14
%
That is why I am so eager to preach the gospel also to you who are in Rome.
	--Romans 1:15
%
For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God that brings 
salvation to everyone who believes: first to the Jew, then to the Gentile.
	--Romans 1:16
%
For in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed—a righteousness that 
is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: “The righteous will 
live by faith.”
	--Romans 1:17
%
The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and 
wickedness of people, who suppress the truth by their wickedness,
	--Romans 1:18
%
since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it 
plain to them.
	--Romans 1:19
%
For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal 
power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what 
has been made, so that people are without excuse.
	--Romans 1:20
%
For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks 
to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened.
	--Romans 1:21
%
Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools
	--Romans 1:22
%
and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like a 
mortal human being and birds and animals and reptiles.
	--Romans 1:23
%
Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual 
impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another.
	--Romans 1:24
%
They exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshiped and served created 
things rather than the Creator—who is forever praised. Amen.
	--Romans 1:25
%
Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women 
exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones.
	--Romans 1:26
%
In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were 
inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, 
and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.
	--Romans 1:27
%
Furthermore, just as they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge 
of God, so God gave them over to a depraved mind, so that they do what ought 
not to be done.
	--Romans 1:28
%
They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and 
depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are 
gossips,
	--Romans 1:29
%
slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of 
doing evil; they disobey their parents;
	--Romans 1:30
%
they have no understanding, no fidelity, no love, no mercy.
	--Romans 1:31
%
Although they know God’s righteous decree that those who do such things 
deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve 
of those who practice them.
	--Romans 1:32
%
You, therefore, have no excuse, you who pass judgment on someone else, for at 
whatever point you judge another, you are condemning yourself, because you who 
pass judgment do the same things.
	--Romans 2:1
%
Now we know that God’s judgment against those who do such things is based on 
truth.
	--Romans 2:2
%
So when you, a mere human being, pass judgment on them and yet do the same 
things, do you think you will escape God’s judgment?
	--Romans 2:3
%
Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, forbearance and 
patience, not realizing that God’s kindness is intended to lead you to 
repentance?
	--Romans 2:4
%
But because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart, you are storing up 
wrath against yourself for the day of God’s wrath, when his righteous 
judgment will be revealed.
	--Romans 2:5
%
God “will repay each person according to what they have done.”
	--Romans 2:6
%
To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor and immortality, he 
will give eternal life.
	--Romans 2:7
%
But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow evil, 
there will be wrath and anger.
	--Romans 2:8
%
There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil: first 
for the Jew, then for the Gentile;
	--Romans 2:9
%
but glory, honor and peace for everyone who does good: first for the Jew, then 
for the Gentile.
	--Romans 2:10
%
For God does not show favoritism.
	--Romans 2:11
%
All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who 
sin under the law will be judged by the law.
	--Romans 2:12
%
For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in God’s sight, but it 
is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous.
	--Romans 2:13
%
(Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required 
by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law.
	--Romans 2:14
%
They show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their 
consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts sometimes accusing them 
and at other times even defending them.)
	--Romans 2:15
%
This will take place on the day when God judges people’s secrets through 
Jesus Christ, as my gospel declares.
	--Romans 2:16
%
Now you, if you call yourself a Jew; if you rely on the law and boast in God;
	--Romans 2:17
%
if you know his will and approve of what is superior because you are instructed 
by the law;
	--Romans 2:18
%
if you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind, a light for those who 
are in the dark,
	--Romans 2:19
%
an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of little children, because you have in 
the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth—
	--Romans 2:20
%
you, then, who teach others, do you not teach yourself? You who preach against 
stealing, do you steal?
	--Romans 2:21
%
You who say that people should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You 
who abhor idols, do you rob temples?
	--Romans 2:22
%
You who boast in the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law?
	--Romans 2:23
%
As it is written: “God’s name is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of 
you.”
	--Romans 2:24
%
Circumcision has value if you observe the law, but if you break the law, you 
have become as though you had not been circumcised.
	--Romans 2:25
%
So then, if those who are not circumcised keep the law’s requirements, will 
they not be regarded as though they were circumcised?
	--Romans 2:26
%
The one who is not circumcised physically and yet obeys the law will condemn 
you who, even though you have the written code and circumcision, are a 
lawbreaker.
	--Romans 2:27
%
A person is not a Jew who is one only outwardly, nor is circumcision merely 
outward and physical.
	--Romans 2:28
%
No, a person is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is circumcision of 
the heart, by the Spirit, not by the written code. Such a person’s praise is 
not from other people, but from God.
	--Romans 2:29
%
What advantage, then, is there in being a Jew, or what value is there in 
circumcision?
	--Romans 3:1
%
Much in every way! First of all, the Jews have been entrusted with the very 
words of God.
	--Romans 3:2
%
What if some were unfaithful? Will their unfaithfulness nullify God’s 
faithfulness?
	--Romans 3:3
%
Not at all! Let God be true, and every human being a liar. As it is written: 
“So that you may be proved right when you speak and prevail when you judge.”
	--Romans 3:4
%
But if our unrighteousness brings out God’s righteousness more clearly, what 
shall we say? That God is unjust in bringing his wrath on us? (I am using a 
human argument.)
	--Romans 3:5
%
Certainly not! If that were so, how could God judge the world?
	--Romans 3:6
%
Someone might argue, “If my falsehood enhances God’s truthfulness and so 
increases his glory, why am I still condemned as a sinner?”
	--Romans 3:7
%
Why not say—as some slanderously claim that we say—“Let us do evil that 
good may result”? Their condemnation is just!
	--Romans 3:8
%
What shall we conclude then? Do we have any advantage? Not at all! For we have 
already made the charge that Jews and Gentiles alike are all under the power of 
sin.
	--Romans 3:9
%
As it is written: “There is no one righteous, not even one;
	--Romans 3:10
%
    there is no one who understands; there is no one who seeks God.
	--Romans 3:11
%
All have turned away, they have together become worthless; there is no one who 
does good, not even one.”
	--Romans 3:12
%
“Their throats are open graves; their tongues practice deceit.” “The 
poison of vipers is on their lips.”
	--Romans 3:13
%
    “Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.”
	--Romans 3:14
%
“Their feet are swift to shed blood;
	--Romans 3:15
%
    ruin and misery mark their ways,
	--Romans 3:16
%
and the way of peace they do not know.”
	--Romans 3:17
%
    “There is no fear of God before their eyes.”
	--Romans 3:18
%
Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, 
so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God.
	--Romans 3:19
%
Therefore no one will be declared righteous in God’s sight by the works of 
the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of our sin.
	--Romans 3:20
%
But now apart from the law the righteousness of God has been made known, to 
which the Law and the Prophets testify.
	--Romans 3:21
%
This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. 
There is no difference between Jew and Gentile,
	--Romans 3:22
%
for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,
	--Romans 3:23
%
and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by 
Christ Jesus.
	--Romans 3:24
%
God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement, through the shedding of his 
blood—to be received by faith. He did this to demonstrate his righteousness, 
because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand 
unpunished—
	--Romans 3:25
%
he did it to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so as to be 
just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus.
	--Romans 3:26
%
Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. Because of what law? The law that 
requires works? No, because of the law that requires faith.
	--Romans 3:27
%
For we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the 
law.
	--Romans 3:28
%
Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles too? Yes, of 
Gentiles too,
	--Romans 3:29
%
since there is only one God, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the 
uncircumcised through that same faith.
	--Romans 3:30
%
Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the 
law.
	--Romans 3:31
%
What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, 
discovered in this matter?
	--Romans 4:1
%
If, in fact, Abraham was justified by works, he had something to boast 
about—but not before God.
	--Romans 4:2
%
What does Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as 
righteousness.”
	--Romans 4:3
%
Now to the one who works, wages are not credited as a gift but as an obligation.
	--Romans 4:4
%
However, to the one who does not work but trusts God who justifies the ungodly, 
their faith is credited as righteousness.
	--Romans 4:5
%
David says the same thing when he speaks of the blessedness of the one to whom 
God credits righteousness apart from works:
	--Romans 4:6
%
“Blessed are those whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered.
	--Romans 4:7
%
Blessed is the one whose sin the Lord will never count against them.”
	--Romans 4:8
%
Is this blessedness only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We 
have been saying that Abraham’s faith was credited to him as righteousness.
	--Romans 4:9
%
Under what circumstances was it credited? Was it after he was circumcised, or 
before? It was not after, but before!
	--Romans 4:10
%
And he received circumcision as a sign, a seal of the righteousness that he had 
by faith while he was still uncircumcised. So then, he is the father of all who 
believe but have not been circumcised, in order that righteousness might be 
credited to them.
	--Romans 4:11
%
And he is then also the father of the circumcised who not only are circumcised 
but who also follow in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had 
before he was circumcised.
	--Romans 4:12
%
It was not through the law that Abraham and his offspring received the promise 
that he would be heir of the world, but through the righteousness that comes by 
faith.
	--Romans 4:13
%
For if those who depend on the law are heirs, faith means nothing and the 
promise is worthless,
	--Romans 4:14
%
because the law brings wrath. And where there is no law there is no 
transgression.
	--Romans 4:15
%
Therefore, the promise comes by faith, so that it may be by grace and may be 
guaranteed to all Abraham’s offspring—not only to those who are of the law 
but also to those who have the faith of Abraham. He is the father of us all.
	--Romans 4:16
%
As it is written: “I have made you a father of many nations.” He is our 
father in the sight of God, in whom he believed—the God who gives life to the 
dead and calls into being things that were not.
	--Romans 4:17
%
Against all hope, Abraham in hope believed and so became the father of many 
nations, just as it had been said to him, “So shall your offspring be.”
	--Romans 4:18
%
Without weakening in his faith, he faced the fact that his body was as good as 
dead—since he was about a hundred years old—and that Sarah’s womb was 
also dead.
	--Romans 4:19
%
Yet he did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was 
strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God,
	--Romans 4:20
%
being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised.
	--Romans 4:21
%
This is why “it was credited to him as righteousness.”
	--Romans 4:22
%
The words “it was credited to him” were written not for him alone,
	--Romans 4:23
%
but also for us, to whom God will credit righteousness—for us who believe in 
him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead.
	--Romans 4:24
%
He was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our 
justification.
	--Romans 4:25
%
Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God 
through our Lord Jesus Christ,
	--Romans 5:1
%
through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now 
stand. And we boast in the hope of the glory of God.
	--Romans 5:2
%
Not only so, but we also glory in our sufferings, because we know that 
suffering produces perseverance;
	--Romans 5:3
%
perseverance, character; and character, hope.
	--Romans 5:4
%
And hope does not put us to shame, because God’s love has been poured out 
into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us.
	--Romans 5:5
%
You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for 
the ungodly.
	--Romans 5:6
%
Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous person, though for a good person 
someone might possibly dare to die.
	--Romans 5:7
%
But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, 
Christ died for us.
	--Romans 5:8
%
Since we have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved 
from God’s wrath through him!
	--Romans 5:9
%
For if, while we were God’s enemies, we were reconciled to him through the 
death of his Son, how much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved 
through his life!
	--Romans 5:10
%
Not only is this so, but we also boast in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
through whom we have now received reconciliation.
	--Romans 5:11
%
Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through 
sin, and in this way death came to all people, because all sinned—
	--Romans 5:12
%
To be sure, sin was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not 
charged against anyone’s account where there is no law.
	--Romans 5:13
%
Nevertheless, death reigned from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, even 
over those who did not sin by breaking a command, as did Adam, who is a pattern 
of the one to come.
	--Romans 5:14
%
But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of 
the one man, how much more did God’s grace and the gift that came by the 
grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many!
	--Romans 5:15
%
Nor can the gift of God be compared with the result of one man’s sin: The 
judgment followed one sin and brought condemnation, but the gift followed many 
trespasses and brought justification.
	--Romans 5:16
%
For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how 
much more will those who receive God’s abundant provision of grace and of the 
gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ!
	--Romans 5:17
%
Consequently, just as one trespass resulted in condemnation for all people, so 
also one righteous act resulted in justification and life for all people.
	--Romans 5:18
%
For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, 
so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous.
	--Romans 5:19
%
The law was brought in so that the trespass might increase. But where sin 
increased, grace increased all the more,
	--Romans 5:20
%
so that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through 
righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
	--Romans 5:21
%
What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase?
	--Romans 6:1
%
By no means! We are those who have died to sin; how can we live in it any 
longer?
	--Romans 6:2
%
Or don’t you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were 
baptized into his death?
	--Romans 6:3
%
We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, 
just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too 
may live a new life.
	--Romans 6:4
%
For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly also 
be united with him in a resurrection like his.
	--Romans 6:5
%
For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by 
sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin—
	--Romans 6:6
%
because anyone who has died has been set free from sin.
	--Romans 6:7
%
Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him.
	--Romans 6:8
%
For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead, he cannot die again; 
death no longer has mastery over him.
	--Romans 6:9
%
The death he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life he lives, he lives 
to God.
	--Romans 6:10
%
In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus.
	--Romans 6:11
%
Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil 
desires.
	--Romans 6:12
%
Do not offer any part of yourself to sin as an instrument of wickedness, but 
rather offer yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to 
life; and offer every part of yourself to him as an instrument of righteousness.
	--Romans 6:13
%
For sin shall no longer be your master, because you are not under the law, but 
under grace.
	--Romans 6:14
%
What then? Shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace? By no 
means!
	--Romans 6:15
%
Don’t you know that when you offer yourselves to someone as obedient slaves, 
you are slaves of the one you obey—whether you are slaves to sin, which leads 
to death, or to obedience, which leads to righteousness?
	--Romans 6:16
%
But thanks be to God that, though you used to be slaves to sin, you have come 
to obey from your heart the pattern of teaching that has now claimed your 
allegiance.
	--Romans 6:17
%
You have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness.
	--Romans 6:18
%
I am using an example from everyday life because of your human limitations. 
Just as you used to offer yourselves as slaves to impurity and to 
ever-increasing wickedness, so now offer yourselves as slaves to righteousness 
leading to holiness.
	--Romans 6:19
%
When you were slaves to sin, you were free from the control of righteousness.
	--Romans 6:20
%
What benefit did you reap at that time from the things you are now ashamed of? 
Those things result in death!
	--Romans 6:21
%
But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the 
benefit you reap leads to holiness, and the result is eternal life.
	--Romans 6:22
%
For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ 
Jesus our Lord.
	--Romans 6:23
%
Do you not know, brothers and sisters—for I am speaking to those who know the 
law—that the law has authority over someone only as long as that person lives?
	--Romans 7:1
%
For example, by law a married woman is bound to her husband as long as he is 
alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law that binds her to 
him.
	--Romans 7:2
%
So then, if she has sexual relations with another man while her husband is 
still alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is 
released from that law and is not an adulteress if she marries another man.
	--Romans 7:3
%
So, my brothers and sisters, you also died to the law through the body of 
Christ, that you might belong to another, to him who was raised from the dead, 
in order that we might bear fruit for God.
	--Romans 7:4
%
For when we were in the realm of the flesh, the sinful passions aroused by the 
law were at work in us, so that we bore fruit for death.
	--Romans 7:5
%
But now, by dying to what once bound us, we have been released from the law so 
that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the 
written code.
	--Romans 7:6
%
What shall we say, then? Is the law sinful? Certainly not! Nevertheless, I 
would not have known what sin was had it not been for the law. For I would not 
have known what coveting really was if the law had not said, “You shall not 
covet.”
	--Romans 7:7
%
But sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, produced in me 
every kind of coveting. For apart from the law, sin was dead.
	--Romans 7:8
%
Once I was alive apart from the law; but when the commandment came, sin sprang 
to life and I died.
	--Romans 7:9
%
I found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life actually 
brought death.
	--Romans 7:10
%
For sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, deceived me, and 
through the commandment put me to death.
	--Romans 7:11
%
So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous and good.
	--Romans 7:12
%
Did that which is good, then, become death to me? By no means! Nevertheless, in 
order that sin might be recognized as sin, it used what is good to bring about 
my death, so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful.
	--Romans 7:13
%
We know that the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin.
	--Romans 7:14
%
I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I 
hate I do.
	--Romans 7:15
%
And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good.
	--Romans 7:16
%
As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me.
	--Romans 7:17
%
For I know that good itself does not dwell in me, that is, in my sinful nature. 
For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out.
	--Romans 7:18
%
For I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do—this 
I keep on doing.
	--Romans 7:19
%
Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is 
sin living in me that does it.
	--Romans 7:20
%
So I find this law at work: Although I want to do good, evil is right there 
with me.
	--Romans 7:21
%
For in my inner being I delight in God’s law;
	--Romans 7:22
%
but I see another law at work in me, waging war against the law of my mind and 
making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within me.
	--Romans 7:23
%
What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to 
death?
	--Romans 7:24
%
Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I 
myself in my mind am a slave to God’s law, but in my sinful nature a slave to 
the law of sin.
	--Romans 7:25
%
Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus,
	--Romans 8:1
%
because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit who gives life has set you 
free from the law of sin and death.
	--Romans 8:2
%
For what the law was powerless to do because it was weakened by the flesh, God 
did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh to be a sin 
offering. And so he condemned sin in the flesh,
	--Romans 8:3
%
in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fully met in us, 
who do not live according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.
	--Romans 8:4
%
Those who live according to the flesh have their minds set on what the flesh 
desires; but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set 
on what the Spirit desires.
	--Romans 8:5
%
The mind governed by the flesh is death, but the mind governed by the Spirit is 
life and peace.
	--Romans 8:6
%
The mind governed by the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God’s 
law, nor can it do so.
	--Romans 8:7
%
Those who are in the realm of the flesh cannot please God.
	--Romans 8:8
%
You, however, are not in the realm of the flesh but are in the realm of the 
Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God lives in you. And if anyone does not have 
the Spirit of Christ, they do not belong to Christ.
	--Romans 8:9
%
But if Christ is in you, then even though your body is subject to death because 
of sin, the Spirit gives life because of righteousness.
	--Romans 8:10
%
And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, he 
who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies 
because of his Spirit who lives in you.
	--Romans 8:11
%
Therefore, brothers and sisters, we have an obligation—but it is not to the 
flesh, to live according to it.
	--Romans 8:12
%
For if you live according to the flesh, you will die; but if by the Spirit you 
put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live.
	--Romans 8:13
%
For those who are led by the Spirit of God are the children of God.
	--Romans 8:14
%
The Spirit you received does not make you slaves, so that you live in fear 
again; rather, the Spirit you received brought about your adoption to sonship. 
And by him we cry, “Abba, Father.”
	--Romans 8:15
%
The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God’s children.
	--Romans 8:16
%
Now if we are children, then we are heirs—heirs of God and co-heirs with 
Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in 
his glory.
	--Romans 8:17
%
I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory 
that will be revealed in us.
	--Romans 8:18
%
For the creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be 
revealed.
	--Romans 8:19
%
For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by 
the will of the one who subjected it, in hope
	--Romans 8:20
%
that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and 
brought into the freedom and glory of the children of God.
	--Romans 8:21
%
We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth 
right up to the present time.
	--Romans 8:22
%
Not only so, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan 
inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption to sonship, the redemption of our 
bodies.
	--Romans 8:23
%
For in this hope we were saved. But hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who 
hopes for what they already have?
	--Romans 8:24
%
But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently.
	--Romans 8:25
%
In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we 
ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us through wordless 
groans.
	--Romans 8:26
%
And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit 
intercedes for God’s people in accordance with the will of God.
	--Romans 8:27
%
And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, 
who have been called according to his purpose.
	--Romans 8:28
%
For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his 
Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters.
	--Romans 8:29
%
And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; 
those he justified, he also glorified.
	--Romans 8:30
%
What, then, shall we say in response to these things? If God is for us, who can 
be against us?
	--Romans 8:31
%
He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all—how will he not 
also, along with him, graciously give us all things?
	--Romans 8:32
%
Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who 
justifies.
	--Romans 8:33
%
Who then is the one who condemns? No one. Christ Jesus who died—more than 
that, who was raised to life—is at the right hand of God and is also 
interceding for us.
	--Romans 8:34
%
Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or 
persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?
	--Romans 8:35
%
As it is written: “For your sake we face death all day long; we are 
considered as sheep to be slaughtered.”
	--Romans 8:36
%
No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.
	--Romans 8:37
%
For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, 
neither the present nor the future, nor any powers,
	--Romans 8:38
%
neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to 
separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
	--Romans 8:39
%
I speak the truth in Christ—I am not lying, my conscience confirms it through 
the Holy Spirit—
	--Romans 9:1
%
I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart.
	--Romans 9:2
%
For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the sake 
of my people, those of my own race,
	--Romans 9:3
%
the people of Israel. Theirs is the adoption to sonship; theirs the divine 
glory, the covenants, the receiving of the law, the temple worship and the 
promises.
	--Romans 9:4
%
Theirs are the patriarchs, and from them is traced the human ancestry of the 
Messiah, who is God over all, forever praised! Amen.
	--Romans 9:5
%
It is not as though God’s word had failed. For not all who are descended from 
Israel are Israel.
	--Romans 9:6
%
Nor because they are his descendants are they all Abraham’s children. On the 
contrary, “It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.”
	--Romans 9:7
%
In other words, it is not the children by physical descent who are God’s 
children, but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as Abraham’s 
offspring.
	--Romans 9:8
%
For this was how the promise was stated: “At the appointed time I will 
return, and Sarah will have a son.”
	--Romans 9:9
%
Not only that, but Rebekah’s children were conceived at the same time by our 
father Isaac.
	--Romans 9:10
%
Yet, before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad—in order 
that God’s purpose in election might stand:
	--Romans 9:11
%
not by works but by him who calls—she was told, “The older will serve the 
younger.”
	--Romans 9:12
%
Just as it is written: “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”
	--Romans 9:13
%
What then shall we say? Is God unjust? Not at all!
	--Romans 9:14
%
For he says to Moses, “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will 
have compassion on whom I have compassion.”
	--Romans 9:15
%
It does not, therefore, depend on human desire or effort, but on God’s mercy.
	--Romans 9:16
%
For Scripture says to Pharaoh: “I raised you up for this very purpose, that I 
might display my power in you and that my name might be proclaimed in all the 
earth.”
	--Romans 9:17
%
Therefore God has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy, and he hardens whom he 
wants to harden.
	--Romans 9:18
%
One of you will say to me: “Then why does God still blame us? For who is able 
to resist his will?”
	--Romans 9:19
%
But who are you, a human being, to talk back to God? “Shall what is formed 
say to the one who formed it, ‘Why did you make me like this?’”
	--Romans 9:20
%
Does not the potter have the right to make out of the same lump of clay some 
pottery for special purposes and some for common use?
	--Romans 9:21
%
What if God, although choosing to show his wrath and make his power known, bore 
with great patience the objects of his wrath—prepared for destruction?
	--Romans 9:22
%
What if he did this to make the riches of his glory known to the objects of his 
mercy, whom he prepared in advance for glory—
	--Romans 9:23
%
even us, whom he also called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles?
	--Romans 9:24
%
As he says in Hosea: “I will call them ‘my people’ who are not my people; 
and I will call her ‘my loved one’ who is not my loved one,”
	--Romans 9:25
%
and, “In the very place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my 
people,’ there they will be called ‘children of the living God.’”
	--Romans 9:26
%
Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: “Though the number of the Israelites be 
like the sand by the sea, only the remnant will be saved.
	--Romans 9:27
%
For the Lord will carry out his sentence on earth with speed and finality.”
	--Romans 9:28
%
It is just as Isaiah said previously: “Unless the Lord Almighty had left us 
descendants, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like 
Gomorrah.”
	--Romans 9:29
%
What then shall we say? That the Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, 
have obtained it, a righteousness that is by faith;
	--Romans 9:30
%
but the people of Israel, who pursued the law as the way of righteousness, have 
not attained their goal.
	--Romans 9:31
%
Why not? Because they pursued it not by faith but as if it were by works. They 
stumbled over the stumbling stone.
	--Romans 9:32
%
As it is written: “See, I lay in Zion a stone that causes people to stumble 
and a rock that makes them fall, and the one who believes in him will never be 
put to shame.”
	--Romans 9:33
%
Brothers and sisters, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for the Israelites 
is that they may be saved.
	--Romans 10:1
%
For I can testify about them that they are zealous for God, but their zeal is 
not based on knowledge.
	--Romans 10:2
%
Since they did not know the righteousness of God and sought to establish their 
own, they did not submit to God’s righteousness.
	--Romans 10:3
%
Christ is the culmination of the law so that there may be righteousness for 
everyone who believes.
	--Romans 10:4
%
Moses writes this about the righteousness that is by the law: “The person who 
does these things will live by them.”
	--Romans 10:5
%
But the righteousness that is by faith says: “Do not say in your heart, 
‘Who will ascend into heaven?’” (that is, to bring Christ down)
	--Romans 10:6
%
“or ‘Who will descend into the deep?’” (that is, to bring Christ up 
from the dead).
	--Romans 10:7
%
But what does it say? “The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your 
heart,” that is, the message concerning faith that we proclaim:
	--Romans 10:8
%
If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart 
that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
	--Romans 10:9
%
For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with 
your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved.
	--Romans 10:10
%
As Scripture says, “Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame.”
	--Romans 10:11
%
For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile—the same Lord is Lord of 
all and richly blesses all who call on him,
	--Romans 10:12
%
for, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”
	--Romans 10:13
%
How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they 
believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without 
someone preaching to them?
	--Romans 10:14
%
And how can anyone preach unless they are sent? As it is written: “How 
beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!”
	--Romans 10:15
%
But not all the Israelites accepted the good news. For Isaiah says, “Lord, 
who has believed our message?”
	--Romans 10:16
%
Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard 
through the word about Christ.
	--Romans 10:17
%
But I ask: Did they not hear? Of course they did: “Their voice has gone out 
into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world.”
	--Romans 10:18
%
Again I ask: Did Israel not understand? First, Moses says, “I will make you 
envious by those who are not a nation; I will make you angry by a nation that 
has no understanding.”
	--Romans 10:19
%
And Isaiah boldly says, “I was found by those who did not seek me; I revealed 
myself to those who did not ask for me.”
	--Romans 10:20
%
But concerning Israel he says, “All day long I have held out my hands to a 
disobedient and obstinate people.”
	--Romans 10:21
%
I ask then: Did God reject his people? By no means! I am an Israelite myself, a 
descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin.
	--Romans 11:1
%
God did not reject his people, whom he foreknew. Don’t you know what 
Scripture says in the passage about Elijah—how he appealed to God against 
Israel:
	--Romans 11:2
%
“Lord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars; I am the 
only one left, and they are trying to kill me”?
	--Romans 11:3
%
And what was God’s answer to him? “I have reserved for myself seven 
thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal.”
	--Romans 11:4
%
So too, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace.
	--Romans 11:5
%
And if by grace, then it cannot be based on works; if it were, grace would no 
longer be grace.
	--Romans 11:6
%
What then? What the people of Israel sought so earnestly they did not obtain. 
The elect among them did, but the others were hardened,
	--Romans 11:7
%
as it is written: “God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that could not see 
and ears that could not hear, to this very day.”
	--Romans 11:8
%
And David says: “May their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block 
and a retribution for them.
	--Romans 11:9
%
May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, and their backs be bent 
forever.”
	--Romans 11:10
%
Again I ask: Did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery? Not at all! 
Rather, because of their transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles to 
make Israel envious.
	--Romans 11:11
%
But if their transgression means riches for the world, and their loss means 
riches for the Gentiles, how much greater riches will their full inclusion 
bring!
	--Romans 11:12
%
I am talking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I 
take pride in my ministry
	--Romans 11:13
%
in the hope that I may somehow arouse my own people to envy and save some of 
them.
	--Romans 11:14
%
For if their rejection brought reconciliation to the world, what will their 
acceptance be but life from the dead?
	--Romans 11:15
%
If the part of the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, then the whole batch 
is holy; if the root is holy, so are the branches.
	--Romans 11:16
%
If some of the branches have been broken off, and you, though a wild olive 
shoot, have been grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing 
sap from the olive root,
	--Romans 11:17
%
do not consider yourself to be superior to those other branches. If you do, 
consider this: You do not support the root, but the root supports you.
	--Romans 11:18
%
You will say then, “Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in.”
	--Romans 11:19
%
Granted. But they were broken off because of unbelief, and you stand by faith. 
Do not be arrogant, but tremble.
	--Romans 11:20
%
For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either.
	--Romans 11:21
%
Consider therefore the kindness and sternness of God: sternness to those who 
fell, but kindness to you, provided that you continue in his kindness. 
Otherwise, you also will be cut off.
	--Romans 11:22
%
And if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God is 
able to graft them in again.
	--Romans 11:23
%
After all, if you were cut out of an olive tree that is wild by nature, and 
contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more 
readily will these, the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree!
	--Romans 11:24
%
I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers and sisters, so that 
you may not be conceited: Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the 
full number of the Gentiles has come in,
	--Romans 11:25
%
and in this way all Israel will be saved. As it is written: “The deliverer 
will come from Zion; he will turn godlessness away from Jacob.
	--Romans 11:26
%
And this is my covenant with them when I take away their sins.”
	--Romans 11:27
%
As far as the gospel is concerned, they are enemies for your sake; but as far 
as election is concerned, they are loved on account of the patriarchs,
	--Romans 11:28
%
for God’s gifts and his call are irrevocable.
	--Romans 11:29
%
Just as you who were at one time disobedient to God have now received mercy as 
a result of their disobedience,
	--Romans 11:30
%
so they too have now become disobedient in order that they too may now receive 
mercy as a result of God’s mercy to you.
	--Romans 11:31
%
For God has bound everyone over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on 
them all.
	--Romans 11:32
%
Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How 
unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out!
	--Romans 11:33
%
“Who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor?”
	--Romans 11:34
%
“Who has ever given to God, that God should repay them?”
	--Romans 11:35
%
For from him and through him and for him are all things. To him be the glory 
forever! Amen.
	--Romans 11:36
%
Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God’s mercy, to offer 
your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God—this is your true 
and proper worship.
	--Romans 12:1
%
Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing 
of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will 
is—his good, pleasing and perfect will.
	--Romans 12:2
%
For by the grace given me I say to every one of you: Do not think of yourself 
more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment, 
in accordance with the faith God has distributed to each of you.
	--Romans 12:3
%
For just as each of us has one body with many members, and these members do not 
all have the same function,
	--Romans 12:4
%
so in Christ we, though many, form one body, and each member belongs to all the 
others.
	--Romans 12:5
%
We have different gifts, according to the grace given to each of us. If your 
gift is prophesying, then prophesy in accordance with your faith;
	--Romans 12:6
%
if it is serving, then serve; if it is teaching, then teach;
	--Romans 12:7
%
if it is to encourage, then give encouragement; if it is giving, then give 
generously; if it is to lead, do it diligently; if it is to show mercy, do it 
cheerfully.
	--Romans 12:8
%
Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good.
	--Romans 12:9
%
Be devoted to one another in love. Honor one another above yourselves.
	--Romans 12:10
%
Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervor, serving the Lord.
	--Romans 12:11
%
Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer.
	--Romans 12:12
%
Share with the Lord’s people who are in need. Practice hospitality.
	--Romans 12:13
%
Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse.
	--Romans 12:14
%
Rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn with those who mourn.
	--Romans 12:15
%
Live in harmony with one another. Do not be proud, but be willing to associate 
with people of low position. Do not be conceited.
	--Romans 12:16
%
Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the eyes 
of everyone.
	--Romans 12:17
%
If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone.
	--Romans 12:18
%
Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God’s wrath, for it 
is written: “It is mine to avenge; I will repay,” says the Lord.
	--Romans 12:19
%
On the contrary: “If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give 
him something to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his 
head.”
	--Romans 12:20
%
Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
	--Romans 12:21
%
Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority 
except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been 
established by God.
	--Romans 13:1
%
Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what 
God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves.
	--Romans 13:2
%
For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. 
Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right 
and you will be commended.
	--Romans 13:3
%
For the one in authority is God’s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, 
be afraid, for rulers do not bear the sword for no reason. They are God’s 
servants, agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer.
	--Romans 13:4
%
Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of 
possible punishment but also as a matter of conscience.
	--Romans 13:5
%
This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God’s servants, who 
give their full time to governing.
	--Romans 13:6
%
Give to everyone what you owe them: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, 
then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.
	--Romans 13:7
%
Let no debt remain outstanding, except the continuing debt to love one another, 
for whoever loves others has fulfilled the law.
	--Romans 13:8
%
The commandments, “You shall not commit adultery,” “You shall not 
murder,” “You shall not steal,” “You shall not covet,” and whatever 
other command there may be, are summed up in this one command: “Love your 
neighbor as yourself.”
	--Romans 13:9
%
Love does no harm to a neighbor. Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.
	--Romans 13:10
%
And do this, understanding the present time: The hour has already come for you 
to wake up from your slumber, because our salvation is nearer now than when we 
first believed.
	--Romans 13:11
%
The night is nearly over; the day is almost here. So let us put aside the deeds 
of darkness and put on the armor of light.
	--Romans 13:12
%
Let us behave decently, as in the daytime, not in carousing and drunkenness, 
not in sexual immorality and debauchery, not in dissension and jealousy.
	--Romans 13:13
%
Rather, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not think about 
how to gratify the desires of the flesh.
	"--Romans 13:14
%
Accept the one whose faith is weak, without quarreling over disputable matters.
	"--Romans 14:1
%
One person’s faith allows them to eat anything, but another, whose faith is 
weak, eats only vegetables.
	"--Romans 14:2
%
The one who eats everything must not treat with contempt the one who does not, 
and the one who does not eat everything must not judge the one who does, for 
God has accepted them.
	"--Romans 14:3
%
Who are you to judge someone else’s servant? To their own master, servants 
stand or fall. And they will stand, for the Lord is able to make them stand.
	"--Romans 14:4
%
One person considers one day more sacred than another; another considers every 
day alike. Each of them should be fully convinced in their own mind.
	"--Romans 14:5
%
Whoever regards one day as special does so to the Lord. Whoever eats meat does 
so to the Lord, for they give thanks to God; and whoever abstains does so to 
the Lord and gives thanks to God.
	"--Romans 14:6
%
For none of us lives for ourselves alone, and none of us dies for ourselves 
alone.
	"--Romans 14:7
%
If we live, we live for the Lord; and if we die, we die for the Lord. So, 
whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord.
	"--Romans 14:8
%
For this very reason, Christ died and returned to life so that he might be the 
Lord of both the dead and the living.
	"--Romans 14:9
%
You, then, why do you judge your brother or sister? Or why do you treat them 
with contempt? For we will all stand before God’s judgment seat.
	"--Romans 14:10
%
It is written: “‘As surely as I live,’ says the Lord, ‘every knee will 
bow before me; every tongue will acknowledge God.’”
	"--Romans 14:11
%
So then, each of us will give an account of ourselves to God.
	"--Romans 14:12
%
Therefore let us stop passing judgment on one another. Instead, make up your 
mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in the way of a brother or 
sister.
	"--Romans 14:13
%
I am convinced, being fully persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is 
unclean in itself. But if anyone regards something as unclean, then for that 
person it is unclean.
	"--Romans 14:14
%
If your brother or sister is distressed because of what you eat, you are no 
longer acting in love. Do not by your eating destroy someone for whom Christ 
died.
	"--Romans 14:15
%
Therefore do not let what you know is good be spoken of as evil.
	"--Romans 14:16
%
For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of 
righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit,
	"--Romans 14:17
%
because anyone who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and receives 
human approval.
	"--Romans 14:18
%
Let us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual 
edification.
	"--Romans 14:19
%
Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. All food is clean, but it 
is wrong for a person to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble.
	"--Romans 14:20
%
It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything else that will 
cause your brother or sister to fall.
	"--Romans 14:21
%
So whatever you believe about these things keep between yourself and God. 
Blessed is the one who does not condemn himself by what he approves.
	"--Romans 14:22
%
But whoever has doubts is condemned if they eat, because their eating is not 
from faith; and everything that does not come from faith is sin.
	"--Romans 14:23
%
We who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak and not to please 
ourselves.
	"--Romans 15:1
%
Each of us should please our neighbors for their good, to build them up.
	"--Romans 15:2
%
For even Christ did not please himself but, as it is written: “The insults of 
those who insult you have fallen on me.”
	"--Romans 15:3
%
For everything that was written in the past was written to teach us, so that 
through the endurance taught in the Scriptures and the encouragement they 
provide we might have hope.
	"--Romans 15:4
%
May the God who gives endurance and encouragement give you the same attitude of 
mind toward each other that Christ Jesus had,
	"--Romans 15:5
%
so that with one mind and one voice you may glorify the God and Father of our 
Lord Jesus Christ.
	"--Romans 15:6
%
Accept one another, then, just as Christ accepted you, in order to bring praise 
to God.
	"--Romans 15:7
%
For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the Jews on behalf of 
God’s truth, so that the promises made to the patriarchs might be confirmed
	"--Romans 15:8
%
and, moreover, that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is 
written: “Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles; I will sing the 
praises of your name.”
	"--Romans 15:9
%
Again, it says, “Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people.”
	"--Romans 15:10
%
And again, “Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles; let all the peoples extol 
him.”
	"--Romans 15:11
%
And again, Isaiah says, “The Root of Jesse will spring up, one who will arise 
to rule over the nations; in him the Gentiles will hope.”
	"--Romans 15:12
%
May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so 
that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.
	"--Romans 15:13
%
I myself am convinced, my brothers and sisters, that you yourselves are full of 
goodness, filled with knowledge and competent to instruct one another.
	"--Romans 15:14
%
Yet I have written you quite boldly on some points to remind you of them again, 
because of the grace God gave me
	"--Romans 15:15
%
to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles. He gave me the priestly duty 
of proclaiming the gospel of God, so that the Gentiles might become an offering 
acceptable to God, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
	"--Romans 15:16
%
Therefore I glory in Christ Jesus in my service to God.
	"--Romans 15:17
%
I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished 
through me in leading the Gentiles to obey God by what I have said and done—
	"--Romans 15:18
%
by the power of signs and wonders, through the power of the Spirit of God. So 
from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum, I have fully proclaimed the 
gospel of Christ.
	"--Romans 15:19
%
It has always been my ambition to preach the gospel where Christ was not known, 
so that I would not be building on someone else’s foundation.
	"--Romans 15:20
%
Rather, as it is written: “Those who were not told about him will see, and 
those who have not heard will understand.”
	"--Romans 15:21
%
This is why I have often been hindered from coming to you.
	"--Romans 15:22
%
But now that there is no more place for me to work in these regions, and since 
I have been longing for many years to visit you,
	"--Romans 15:23
%
I plan to do so when I go to Spain. I hope to see you while passing through and 
to have you assist me on my journey there, after I have enjoyed your company 
for a while.
	"--Romans 15:24
%
Now, however, I am on my way to Jerusalem in the service of the Lord’s people 
there.
	"--Romans 15:25
%
For Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to make a contribution for the poor among 
the Lord’s people in Jerusalem.
	"--Romans 15:26
%
They were pleased to do it, and indeed they owe it to them. For if the Gentiles 
have shared in the Jews’ spiritual blessings, they owe it to the Jews to 
share with them their material blessings.
	"--Romans 15:27
%
So after I have completed this task and have made sure that they have received 
this contribution, I will go to Spain and visit you on the way.
	"--Romans 15:28
%
I know that when I come to you, I will come in the full measure of the blessing 
of Christ.
	"--Romans 15:29
%
I urge you, brothers and sisters, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of 
the Spirit, to join me in my struggle by praying to God for me.
	"--Romans 15:30
%
Pray that I may be kept safe from the unbelievers in Judea and that the 
contribution I take to Jerusalem may be favorably received by the Lord’s 
people there,
	"--Romans 15:31
%
so that I may come to you with joy, by God’s will, and in your company be 
refreshed.
	"--Romans 15:32
%
The God of peace be with you all. Amen.
	"--Romans 15:33
%
I commend to you our sister Phoebe, a deacon of the church in Cenchreae.
	"--Romans 16:1
%
I ask you to receive her in the Lord in a way worthy of his people and to give 
her any help she may need from you, for she has been the benefactor of many 
people, including me.
	"--Romans 16:2
%
Greet Priscilla and Aquila, my co-workers in Christ Jesus.
	"--Romans 16:3
%
They risked their lives for me. Not only I but all the churches of the Gentiles 
are grateful to them.
	"--Romans 16:4
%
Greet also the church that meets at their house. Greet my dear friend Epenetus, 
who was the first convert to Christ in the province of Asia.
	"--Romans 16:5
%
Greet Mary, who worked very hard for you.
	"--Romans 16:6
%
Greet Andronicus and Junia, my fellow Jews who have been in prison with me. 
They are outstanding among the apostles, and they were in Christ before I was.
	"--Romans 16:7
%
Greet Ampliatus, my dear friend in the Lord.
	"--Romans 16:8
%
Greet Urbanus, our co-worker in Christ, and my dear friend Stachys.
	"--Romans 16:9
%
Greet Apelles, whose fidelity to Christ has stood the test. Greet those who 
belong to the household of Aristobulus.
	"--Romans 16:10
%
Greet Herodion, my fellow Jew. Greet those in the household of Narcissus who 
are in the Lord.
	"--Romans 16:11
%
Greet Tryphena and Tryphosa, those women who work hard in the Lord. Greet my 
dear friend Persis, another woman who has worked very hard in the Lord.
	"--Romans 16:12
%
Greet Rufus, chosen in the Lord, and his mother, who has been a mother to me, 
too.
	"--Romans 16:13
%
Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas and the other brothers and 
sisters with them.
	"--Romans 16:14
%
Greet Philologus, Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas and all the 
Lord’s people who are with them.
	"--Romans 16:15
%
Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ send greetings.
	"--Romans 16:16
%
I urge you, brothers and sisters, to watch out for those who cause divisions 
and put obstacles in your way that are contrary to the teaching you have 
learned. Keep away from them.
	"--Romans 16:17
%
For such people are not serving our Lord Christ, but their own appetites. By 
smooth talk and flattery they deceive the minds of naive people.
	"--Romans 16:18
%
Everyone has heard about your obedience, so I rejoice because of you; but I 
want you to be wise about what is good, and innocent about what is evil.
	"--Romans 16:19
%
The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord 
Jesus be with you.
	"--Romans 16:20
%
Timothy, my co-worker, sends his greetings to you, as do Lucius, Jason and 
Sosipater, my fellow Jews.
	"--Romans 16:21
%
I, Tertius, who wrote down this letter, greet you in the Lord.
	"--Romans 16:22
%
Gaius, whose hospitality I and the whole church here enjoy, sends you his 
greetings. Erastus, who is the city’s director of public works, and our 
brother Quartus send you their greetings.
	"--Romans 16:23
%

	"--Romans 16:24

Now to him who is able to establish you in accordance with my gospel, the 
message I proclaim about Jesus Christ, in keeping with the revelation of the 
mystery hidden for long ages past,
	"--Romans 16:25
%
but now revealed and made known through the prophetic writings by the command 
of the eternal God, so that all the Gentiles might come to the obedience that 
comes from faith—
	"--Romans 16:26
%
to the only wise God be glory forever through Jesus Christ! Amen.
	"--Romans 16:27
%
Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ to further the faith of 
God’s elect and their knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness—
	 --Titus 1:1
%
in the hope of eternal life, which God, who does not lie, promised before the 
beginning of time,
	 --Titus 1:2
%
and which now at his appointed season he has brought to light through the 
preaching entrusted to me by the command of God our Savior,
	 --Titus 1:3
%
To Titus, my true son in our common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father 
and Christ Jesus our Savior.
	 --Titus 1:4
%
The reason I left you in Crete was that you might put in order what was left 
unfinished and appoint elders in every town, as I directed you.
	 --Titus 1:5
%
An elder must be blameless, faithful to his wife, a man whose children believe 
and are not open to the charge of being wild and disobedient.
	 --Titus 1:6
%
Since an overseer manages God’s household, he must be blameless—not 
overbearing, not quick-tempered, not given to drunkenness, not violent, not 
pursuing dishonest gain.
	 --Titus 1:7
%
Rather, he must be hospitable, one who loves what is good, who is 
self-controlled, upright, holy and disciplined.
	 --Titus 1:8
%
He must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught, so that 
he can encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it.
	 --Titus 1:9
%
For there are many rebellious people, full of meaningless talk and deception, 
especially those of the circumcision group.
	 --Titus 1:10
%
They must be silenced, because they are disrupting whole households by teaching 
things they ought not to teach—and that for the sake of dishonest gain.
	 --Titus 1:11
%
One of Crete’s own prophets has said it: “Cretans are always liars, evil 
brutes, lazy gluttons.”
	 --Titus 1:12
%
This saying is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, so that they will be sound 
in the faith
	 --Titus 1:13
%
and will pay no attention to Jewish myths or to the merely human commands of 
those who reject the truth.
	 --Titus 1:14
%
To the pure, all things are pure, but to those who are corrupted and do not 
believe, nothing is pure. In fact, both their minds and consciences are 
corrupted.
	 --Titus 1:15
%
They claim to know God, but by their actions they deny him. They are 
detestable, disobedient and unfit for doing anything good.
	 --Titus 1:16
%
You, however, must teach what is appropriate to sound doctrine.
	 --Titus 2:1
%
Teach the older men to be temperate, worthy of respect, self-controlled, and 
sound in faith, in love and in endurance.
	 --Titus 2:2
%
Likewise, teach the older women to be reverent in the way they live, not to be 
slanderers or addicted to much wine, but to teach what is good.
	 --Titus 2:3
%
Then they can urge the younger women to love their husbands and children,
	 --Titus 2:4
%
to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home, to be kind, and to be 
subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word of God.
	 --Titus 2:5
%
Similarly, encourage the young men to be self-controlled.
	 --Titus 2:6
%
In everything set them an example by doing what is good. In your teaching show 
integrity, seriousness
	 --Titus 2:7
%
and soundness of speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose you 
may be ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us.
	 --Titus 2:8
%
Teach slaves to be subject to their masters in everything, to try to please 
them, not to talk back to them,
	 --Titus 2:9
%
and not to steal from them, but to show that they can be fully trusted, so that 
in every way they will make the teaching about God our Savior attractive.
	 --Titus 2:10
%
For the grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people.
	 --Titus 2:11
%
It teaches us to say “No” to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live 
self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this present age,
	 --Titus 2:12
%
while we wait for the blessed hope—the appearing of the glory of our great 
God and Savior, Jesus Christ,
	 --Titus 2:13
%
who gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for 
himself a people that are his very own, eager to do what is good.
	 --Titus 2:14
%
These, then, are the things you should teach. Encourage and rebuke with all 
authority. Do not let anyone despise you.
	 --Titus 2:15
%
Remind the people to be subject to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to 
be ready to do whatever is good,
	 --Titus 3:1
%
to slander no one, to be peaceable and considerate, and always to be gentle 
toward everyone.
	 --Titus 3:2
%
At one time we too were foolish, disobedient, deceived and enslaved by all 
kinds of passions and pleasures. We lived in malice and envy, being hated and 
hating one another.
	 --Titus 3:3
%
But when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared,
	 --Titus 3:4
%
he saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his 
mercy. He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy 
Spirit,
	 --Titus 3:5
%
whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior,
	 --Titus 3:6
%
so that, having been justified by his grace, we might become heirs having the 
hope of eternal life.
	 --Titus 3:7
%
This is a trustworthy saying. And I want you to stress these things, so that 
those who have trusted in God may be careful to devote themselves to doing what 
is good. These things are excellent and profitable for everyone.
	 --Titus 3:8
%
But avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and arguments and quarrels 
about the law, because these are unprofitable and useless.
	 --Titus 3:9
%
Warn a divisive person once, and then warn them a second time. After that, have 
nothing to do with them.
	 --Titus 3:10
%
You may be sure that such people are warped and sinful; they are self-condemned.
	 --Titus 3:11
%
As soon as I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, do your best to come to me at 
Nicopolis, because I have decided to winter there.
	 --Titus 3:12
%
Do everything you can to help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way and see 
that they have everything they need.
	 --Titus 3:13
%
Our people must learn to devote themselves to doing what is good, in order to 
provide for urgent needs and not live unproductive lives.
	 --Titus 3:14
%
Everyone with me sends you greetings. Greet those who love us in the faith. 
Grace be with you all.
